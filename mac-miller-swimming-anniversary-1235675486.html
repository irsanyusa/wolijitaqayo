Looking back five years after its release, the album acts as a sort of admission of his spirit<strong> </strong>and an unrealized farewell.&nbsp;Built as the counterpart to its 2020 successor “Circles” (as in “Swimming” in “Circles”), the former peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, where it’s stayed for 235 weeks. “Swimming” became certified platinum in February 2021 — making it Miller’s first project to do so — and became double platinum in June 2023.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rising to popularity in late 2010 for his “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>frat rap</a>” sound, Miller’s debut album “Blue Slide Park” (2011) earned an infamous <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>1.0 rating from Pitchfork</a>, driving the narrative that he was yet another rapper whose repertoire was defined by “lust[ing] after fame, money and women.” And while he rapped about “tryin’ to get a mansion” in the dawn of his career, Miller quickly came into his own.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He swapped out party beats about materialism and fame (“money what I’m bout / trying to get so much that I can’t keep count”) for personalized R&B tones that matched his evolving identity as an artist who swam against the ebb and flow of life through his work (“Gray skies are driftin’, not livin’ forever / They told me it only gets better”).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Each of Miller’s studio albums peeled back a new layer of his artistry. “Blue Slide Park” banked on the party rap sound that drew in his initial fanbase. “Watching Movies With the Sound Off” rid him of the empty-artist stereotype and introduced grave conversations about drug use. On “GO:OD AM,” a fully realized point of view cemented Miller’s presence in rap, and with “The Divine Feminine,” he created a romantic, erotic diary entry.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He publicly dealt with substance addiction — a theme discussed throughout his body of work. With “Swimming,” it seemed as though Miller had gained somewhat of a grasp on his addiction, in contrast to his 2014 mixtape “Faces,” in which he warned listeners of the temptations of “snowflakes fallin’ on expired debit cards.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Swimming” signified a fresh start for Miller. While recognizing his past, it was sealed with a pact to do and be better (He declares he once “was drowning, but now I’m swimmin’,” in the opening track).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Miller’s tragic absence in the music industry has been amplified in the time after his death. With each year, the fervent glow of his passionate fanbase gets reignited on the anniversary of “Swimming.” It would go on to land Miller his first and only Grammy nomination for best rap album, but critical acclaim was never something the late rapper yearned for.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Stop keeping score,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>he wrote</a> in a 2018 tweet. “Just keep swimming.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Five years after its release, Variety lists eight tracks from “Swimming” that stand as the most moving from the album.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“Come Back to Earth”</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The aura of “Swimming’s” opening track at first appears melancholic, but Miller’s lyrics reveal a pragmatic truth — he was confessing his demons. He reflects back on his past state (“drownin’”), to his present (“swimmin’”), with the essence of the album emulated in just one line.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“In my own way, this feel like livin’ / Some alternate reality / And I was drownin’, but now I’m swimmin’ / Through stressful waters to relief”</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span></figure><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“Hurt Feelings”</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Miller addresses his relationship with fame, affirming that monetary value will never equate to eternal happiness. He raps about the upsides of his stardom (“whips that move mountains / new cribs, blue fountains”), however, he accepts that the industry is all but “just a game.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The most staggering lyrics come in the track’s chorus, an eerie prelude to the emptiness that Miller’s friends, family and fans feel in the wake of his death:</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“Everything is different, I can’t complain / You don’t know what you missin’, shame on you / (Yeah, yeah, yeah) Shame on you (Yeah)”&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“Perfecto”&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Perfecto” supports Miller’s concept of water that’s ever-present in “Swimming.” He’s mindful of his evolving ability to swim, a metaphor for his compulsion. He raspily raps over a relatively upbeat track, but his lyrics reveal the details of his inner conflict: that he’s often paralyzed with melancholy. Miller pronounces he’s neither drowning nor swimming, but “treadin’ water.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“I’m treadin’ water, I swear / That if I drown, I don’t care / They callin’ for me from the shore, I need more”</strong></p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“Self Care”</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Standing as his <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>highest-streamed track</a> to date on Spotify, Miller addresses his faults (“that <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Mercedes drove me crazy</a>, I was speedin’”) while contradictorily pledging that they’re remedied. He challenges the critique of those berating his life over an effortlessly catchy tone. Its music video depicts Miller buried alive in a coffin that he breaks himself out of — a metaphor depicting the reality that he solely relies on himself (and also an homage to “Kill Bill: Volume 2”).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere (Yeah) / Self care, I’m treatin’ me right, yeah / Hell yeah, we gonna be alright (We gon’ be alright)”</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span></figure><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“Wings”</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Miller ushers an unparalleled sense of awareness in “Wings.” Like much of “Swimming,” he considers his mistakes and reveals that he “ain’t feelin’ broken no more,” while still admitting he’s uncertain if this will maintain in the future. Miller’s frame of consciousness is raw as he selflessly exposes himself through its lyrics.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“I’d put some money on forever, but I (Hey) / Don’t like to gamble on the weather, so I / Just watch while / The sun is shinin’, I can look at the horizon / The walls keep gettin’ wider, I just hope I never find ’em, I know”</strong></p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“Jet Fuel”&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Here, Miller confesses the darkest elements of his psyche. He raps about his successes, their prices and his addiction, all in a way that defends not only his choices but his way of life. “Jet Fuel” may be the darkest track on the album, as he not only acknowledges his issues but, in a way, warrants them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“And I ain’t callin’ it quits / You can build a wall with your bricks / While I keep talkin’ that shit, it’s like this (It’s like this) (Hmm) / Liquor still in my cup (My cup) / Get faded when I wake up (Wake up) / ‘Cause everything is too much (Too much)”</strong></p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“2009”</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The lyrics study the life Miller led since 2009, the year before he released his breakout “K.I.D.S.” mixtape. He touches on the hardships of depression, addiction, failed relationships and fame, all well promising that “nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind,” hinting at a positive bloom of his mental state. “2009” is one of the rawest reflections in Miller’s discography, one that feels like a tribute to his past, yet a vow to his future.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“Yeah, they ask me what I’m smilin’ for / Well, because I’ve never been this high before / It’s like I never felt alive before / Mhmm, I’d rather have me peace of mind than war”</strong></p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>“So It Goes”&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Closing out the record, the instrumental outro draws Miller’s final curtain, “Just like a circle, I go back where I’m from.” The score reads as one last ballad, the culmination of a chapter no one knew was ending.&nbsp;In the final moments of the track, he promises that he’s “been out” and is now “back in town,” but here he fibs: <a href=# id=auto-tag_mac-miller_1 data-tag=mac-miller>Mac Miller</a> never left. He’s eternally swimming, just through the breadth of his music.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>“Well, everybody gather round / I’m still standin’, sit down / Whoa-oh/ And I know I been out (And I know I been out) / But now I’m back in town (But now I’m back in town), so I / Show you the ropes / So it goes, so it goes, so it goes”</strong></p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-flex lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-flex-wrap-wrap lrv-u-justify-content-center" aria-labelledby><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Mac Miller</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjqasrKGTZLumw9JopJqbXaK2rbjEq2Ssr5miuqq6xmaYp6aZq7Kzv8CrsGZpYmiCd4OUbW9vZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
