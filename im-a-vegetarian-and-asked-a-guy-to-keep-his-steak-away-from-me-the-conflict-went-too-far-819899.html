She wrote, “I’m a&nbsp;<strong>vegetarian</strong>, and&nbsp;I was trying to&nbsp;avoid cross-contamination at&nbsp;the veggie platter.”</p><p>Jane was accustomed to&nbsp;navigating social events where meat was the centerpiece. She had no&nbsp;issue with others enjoying their steaks and burgers, but she always made a&nbsp;point to&nbsp;avoid any cross-contamination between meat and her plant-based dishes. At&nbsp;this particular barbecue, she had her eye on&nbsp;the veggie platter, carefully selecting her food to&nbsp;ensure it&nbsp;was free from any trace of&nbsp;meat.</p><p>As&nbsp;Jane stood near the grill, fixing her plate with fresh veggies and sides, she noticed a&nbsp;man she didn’t know standing uncomfortably close. She wrote, “Dave, a&nbsp;guy&nbsp;I didn’t know, was chowing down on&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>massive steak</strong> right next to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;politely asked him to&nbsp;keep his steak away from my&nbsp;food.”</p><p>The juices from the steak were dripping perilously close to&nbsp;Jane’s food, and she couldn’t help but feel uneasy. Trying to&nbsp;keep things light and polite, she turned to&nbsp;Dave and asked, “Hey, would you mind keeping your steak a&nbsp;little further from my&nbsp;food? I’m just trying to&nbsp;avoid any cross-contamination.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d84/4c0/769a585e4598c38f2cae9d227f.jpg><p>Jane expected a&nbsp;simple acknowledgment, maybe a&nbsp;quick apology as&nbsp;Dave shifted his plate away. Instead, Dave let out a&nbsp;loud, dismissive laugh. “<strong>I&nbsp;don’t think my&nbsp;steak can infect your veggies!</strong>” he&nbsp;exclaimed, a&nbsp;smirk forming on&nbsp;his face.</p><p>But what happened next caught Jane off guard. Rather than <a href=# title=respecting data-link=tag>respecting</a> her request, Dave deliberately moved his plate even closer to&nbsp;hers, hovering it&nbsp;over the veggie platter as&nbsp;if&nbsp;to&nbsp;taunt her.</p><p>Feeling uncomfortable, Jane decided to&nbsp;confide in&nbsp;her friend, the host of&nbsp;the barbecue. She hoped for some understanding, maybe even a&nbsp;word with Dave to&nbsp;smooth things over. But when she mentioned the situation, her friend merely shrugged. “That’s just Dave being Dave,” she said casually, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;that excused his behavior. “Don’t take it&nbsp;personally.”</p><p>Jane was taken aback by&nbsp;her friend’s indifference. It&nbsp;wasn’t just about a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;steak—it was about feeling respected and welcome. But it&nbsp;seemed that to&nbsp;her friend, Dave’s antics were just part of&nbsp;the package,<strong> something everyone was expected to&nbsp;tolerate</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/30e/191/3942a25e94a55c424cf6a26fcc.png><p>Later in&nbsp;the evening, Jane’s frustration turned to&nbsp;anger when she overheard Dave talking loudly with a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;other guests. He&nbsp;was bragging, almost gleefully, <strong>about how he&nbsp;had “trolled” the vegetarians </strong>at&nbsp;the party.</p><p>He&nbsp;recounted his interactions with Jane, laughing at&nbsp;how he&nbsp;had purposely ignored her request. What’s more, he&nbsp;mentioned making similar comments to&nbsp;other guests who didn’t eat meat, turning his behavior into a&nbsp;twisted joke.</p><p>As&nbsp;the evening wore&nbsp;on, Jane decided to&nbsp;quietly leave the barbecue. What was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;relaxing, enjoyable gathering had turned into a&nbsp;stressful experience. <strong>She couldn’t shake the feeling of&nbsp;being unwelcome</strong>, not just by&nbsp;Dave, but by&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;concern from those who were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;her friends.</p><p>As&nbsp;she walked away, she made a&nbsp;mental note to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more cautious about the company she kept at&nbsp;future events, ensuring that she surrounded herself with people who respected her choices—no matter how different they might be&nbsp;from their own.</p><p>Jane asks you to&nbsp;share your thoughts about her <a href=#>situation</a> and how you would react.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLauecBmrZ6flamus7XAp2SappRirrS3xJ1kmmWXqsZuwM5mop6doGK1qr%2BMrKuemZtirrit2Gadq6edYrqmedOhnGabn6OzrbXCrWSwnZ6perW7zmadmqpdbX56hJhyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
