But the devil is in the details: While countries in Northern Europe show higher levels of antipathy toward Russia, adults in Southern Europe appear to be less perturbed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The big picture</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Poles had the clearest pro-NATO, anti-Russian opinions. Poles may see much of their own history in the Ukraine crisis, as both nations were dominated by Moscow for much of the 20th century. A former member of the Soviet Union’s anti-NATO Warsaw Pact, Poland was able to achieve precisely what Russia now hopes to prevent in former Soviet member state Ukraine: NATO membership and stronger links to the West.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Germans, for their part, were similarly negative on Russia, but were also the most ambivalent about the United States. Jason McMann, Morning Consult’s head of geopolitical risk analysis, said that might be because the United States was hinting it “might go it alone if Germany and other NATO allies cannot harmonize their responses to Russian aggression.” Berlin has so far been uncomfortable with any <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>U.S. troop deployments</a> or weapons shipments to its eastern neighbors or Ukraine, preferring to exhaust all diplomatic options with Russia.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">French President Emmanuel Macron has also stuck to his commitment to diplomacy, and French adults expressed the most ambivalence about NATO. However, it’s important to keep in mind France’s long history of unease with its place inside the alliance, with President Charles de Gaulle going so far as to partially withdraw from the alliance in 1966. Still, McMann noted one trend to watch: France was the only European NATO member country surveyed besides the United Kingdom where positive views toward the alliance grew stronger.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The polls were conducted Oct. 11-Nov. 9, 2021; Nov. 10-Dec. 9, 2021; Dec. 10, 2021-Jan. 8, 2022; and Jan. 9-Feb. 7, 2022.
