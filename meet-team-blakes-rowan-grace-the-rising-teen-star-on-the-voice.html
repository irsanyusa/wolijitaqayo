She first wowed the coaches during the Blind Audition when she sang <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Olivia Rodrigo</a>‘s “Traitor.”</p><p>Contrary to her looks as a young, up-and-coming singer, her voice already has a clear contemporary feel to it. Rowan originally picked to be apart of Team Gwen over Teams Camila and Legend.</p><p>Surprisingly, she would ultimately end up representing the coach who didn’t turn his chair for her Blind Audition. During the Knockout Rounds,Rowan was stolen by Shelton, after singing “Vienna,” by Billy Joel. Shelton used his only Steal to save Rowan and make her a part of Team Blake.</p><p>She already has a voice that could win the show, and her previous coach Gwen Stefani knows that. The only area that Rowan needs to improve on according to Stefani, is her emotions while singing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Was She Up to Before The Voice?</h2><p>Rowan is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singer</a> and songwriter from Rapid City, South Dakota, who started singing at the age of five. She is already able to play the piano and is a trained dancer who’s been a part of a competitive dance team for two years.</p><p>She also has a self-titled band with whom she has performed gigs together with all over the country. Rowan has released four singles so far, which is impressive for someone so young. The first single titled “How I Want It,” was received positively when it was released in 2019.</p><p>One of her other singles, “Paradise,” was used to raise a memorial fund in honor of her classmate who passed away. All proceeds from the single were donated to her friend’s family. Other singles released in 2020 are “Closer,” and “Best Of Me.”</p><p>The young singer truly has a passion for music and singing discovered at a very young age. Her talent has helped her advance to the final stages of The Voice, and she is now one step closer to becoming a champion.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_RandyJackson_Rachel-LunaGetty-Images-220x182.jpg alt="Randy Jackson Explains Why He Walks with a Cane, Says He’s ‘On the Mend’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWkmq6uecGlmKSdo2K%2FsMPAp2SgqpGYsm7Ax55kq6GjnruoedOenKdlo6mus3nOp2StoJViw7C1wp5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
