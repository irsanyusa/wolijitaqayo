 1. Cannibalism  Cannibalism is technically still legal throughout the United States and several other countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom.  However, to indulge one’s appetite for human flesh, a cannibal would first have to find a corpse for his meal, since murder is illegal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Cannibalism</p><p>Cannibalism is technically still legal throughout the United States and several other countries, including Germany and the United Kingdom.</p><p>However, to indulge one’s appetite for human flesh, a cannibal would first have to find a corpse for his meal, since murder is illegal.</p><p>2. Necrophilia</p><p>Committing sex acts on the dead, or necrophilia, is likely to strike most people as horrific, but in some US states, India and parts of Africa, it’s not illegal. As late as 2015, “adultery, sodomy, blasphemy, and the act of displaying an albino in public for hire” were illegal in Massachusetts but necrophilia isn’t.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>3. Bestiality</p><p>In some countries, this act remains legal. In Germany, “erotic zoos” cater to the bizarre fetish, although intimate relations between humans and animals aren’t restricted to these “bestiality brothels.”</p><p>The practice is also legal in Hungary, Finland, Mexico, and the states of Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p><p>In Alabama, 2014 legislation would have outlawed the act, but the governor vetoed it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>4. Female Genital Mutilation</p><p>The most common form of FGM, the removal of the clitoris, often without anaesthesia. Infibulation entails the clitoris and external genitalia being removed, and “the bleeding raw edges of the large lips are held together by thorns or other fastening devices” to allow developing scar tissue to seal the vaginal entrance.</p><p>This terrible procedure is most often performed in Sudan, Somalia, Northern Kenya, parts of Ethiopia, up and down the Red Sea Coasts, parts of Mali, and surrounding areas.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In India, a husband is allowed to rape his wife. Marital rape is also legal in Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. In 2016, Indian legislation proposed to specify that “marriage should not be considered as an irrevocable consent to sexual acts,” but the change to the nation’s sexual assault laws was rejected.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cLzUpaqeZZyewLV5lGafqKqinrOqr4yamq2rXam1osCMmqmeZZyatKK4jKKlZquforJur86upa2qmZrAcMbCnp%2BqrqA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
