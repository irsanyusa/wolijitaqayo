It&nbsp;turns into a&nbsp;vicious circle of&nbsp;<a href=#>toxic relationships</a>, but, fortunately, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way out of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Emotionally dependent people put their partner on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pedestal and build their whole lives around them. They try to&nbsp;either completely control their partner, or&nbsp;they play the role of&nbsp;the victim while they actually derive pleasure from their own suffering.</p><p>Psychotherapist Darlene Lancer <a href=#>writes </a>that true love and emotional dependence are different things and it’s crucial to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;tell them apart.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> collected alarming signs that indicate the beginning of&nbsp;unhealthy affection. Don’t let yourself fall into the trap of&nbsp;toxic <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a>.</p><p><h2>10. You immediately think that you have found the love of&nbsp;your life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65f/82f/e0362553e7aa3e1cb57dab7227.jpg><p>There are people who are very amorous and after the first date they race home with feelings&nbsp;of, “This is&nbsp;the perfect person whom I’ve been waiting for all my&nbsp;life!” Unfortunately, it&nbsp;often turns out that this is&nbsp;not&nbsp;so. After meeting someone who gives you butterflies, wait some time until you cool off to&nbsp;see how you feel.</p><p>If&nbsp;you find yourself in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;situation, take a&nbsp;break every few days to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;your own and do&nbsp;something that distracts you from thinking about this person.</p><p><h2>9. You idealize your partner too much.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ce/a66/bc158e5a2cb1908a37a40edbb8.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the relationship, it’s important to&nbsp;listen more than you speak, and the key is&nbsp;to&nbsp;listen carefully. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;person casually says, “I’m not the easiest person...” then most likely, they’re giving you a&nbsp;heads up&nbsp;about something that they know about themselves that you aren’t aware of&nbsp;yet. If&nbsp;something is&nbsp;mentioned in&nbsp;even the most casual manner, don’t overlook&nbsp;it.</p><p>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;selflessly reassure people that, “It’s all nonsense! We’ll manage!” When someone throws in&nbsp;“warnings” like these, they actually mean that they don’t think that you’re right for them and they don’t want you around or&nbsp;that they’re ready to&nbsp;continue the relationship only on&nbsp;their terms. These aren’t things that someone who is&nbsp;in&nbsp;love would be&nbsp;feeling or&nbsp;saying, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;you find yourself hearing such phrases more often then not, it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;either address the issue or&nbsp;consider whether or&nbsp;not you need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;relationship.</p><p><h2>8. You neglect friends to&nbsp;please your partner.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c0/b33/623d125a6f92df89c83b75890a.jpg><p>Don’t neglect your friends when you enter a&nbsp;relationship. When we&nbsp;first start seeing someone, it’s natural to&nbsp;be&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;this one person and to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share everything with your friends. But you should keep in&nbsp;mind that your friends want to&nbsp;spend time with you and they don’t necessarily want to&nbsp;spend the whole time listening to&nbsp;stories about the person you’re dating.</p><p>Your friends can also have certain feelings about the person you’re seeing, and these feelings are different from yours since their thoughts aren’t clouded by&nbsp;emotions. So&nbsp;it’s better to&nbsp;introduce your partner to&nbsp;your friends early&nbsp;on. Perhaps they will notice something that you haven’t and keep you from immersing yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic relationship. If&nbsp;your partner does not want to&nbsp;get acquainted with your friends and relatives, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;warning sign of&nbsp;the fact that they don’t feel that the relationship is&nbsp;serious.</p><p><h2>7. You forget about your hobby.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33e/7db/32558b5bfca07bfc7bb6933c4c.jpg><p>Don’t forget about your favorite activities and your hobbies. A&nbsp;new person should make your life more interesting and they should add to&nbsp;your life.</p><p>An&nbsp;enthusiastic and active person who is&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;many different things is&nbsp;very attractive as&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner. Don’t make your loved one the center of&nbsp;your universe. It’s important to&nbsp;understand that it’s unfair to&nbsp;your partner if&nbsp;you completely depend on&nbsp;them for your happiness, your well-being, and your overall mood.</p><p><h2>6. You turn a&nbsp;blind eye to&nbsp;alarming signals.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b2/a41/38922f5c88b8e31569ca143de3.jpg><p>Pay attention to&nbsp;any feelings, doubts, and suspicions you may have. If&nbsp;something about your partner’s behavior is&nbsp;disturbing to&nbsp;you, don’t hesitate to&nbsp;address the issue right away. Don’t hope that your partner will change on&nbsp;their own. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;say it&nbsp;once to&nbsp;someone who values you in&nbsp;order for that person to&nbsp;start making an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;improve the situation.</p><p>Don’t feel the need to&nbsp;justify your partner’s actions against you by&nbsp;his childhood traumas, his situation at&nbsp;work, or&nbsp;issues that he’s experiencing in&nbsp;his family. There’s no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;your partner’s savior. If&nbsp;you’re constantly finding yourself playing the role of&nbsp;the victim in&nbsp;your relationship, you need to&nbsp;figure out why.</p><p><h2>5. You unreservedly trust the opinion of&nbsp;your partner.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/091/2b3/21a992538cb69759d4c54aa2dc.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you suddenly catch yourself doing something you never would’ve done before just because your partner pressured you into&nbsp;it, then this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad sign. Replacing your beliefs with those of&nbsp;your partner means that you’re losing a&nbsp;significant part of&nbsp;yourself and you’re not being true to&nbsp;who you are. It’s OK&nbsp;to&nbsp;adjust your beliefs if&nbsp;that’s how you actually feel, but it’s not a&nbsp;good sign if&nbsp;you find yourself blindly agreeing to&nbsp;everything your partner wants you to&nbsp;agree&nbsp;to.</p><p>You risk becoming your partner’s shadow and this will not only lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;health issues, but it&nbsp;will cause your partner to&nbsp;lose interest in&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>4. You feel incredibly jealous over every little thing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d76/a26/c9e3c45534bfa8a5b2decd1c07.jpg><p>Unfortunate experiences in&nbsp;the past or&nbsp;the fear or&nbsp;loneliness shouldn’t affect your present. Do&nbsp;the reasons for your jealousy really exist or&nbsp;are they just in&nbsp;your imagination? It’s possible that excessive feelings of&nbsp;jealousy can put you at&nbsp;risk of&nbsp;losing your partner not because of&nbsp;someone else, but because of&nbsp;you. Nobody can withstand constant distrust and no&nbsp;one wants to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;reassure you of&nbsp;their love.</p><p>There’s another side to&nbsp;the issue of&nbsp;jealousy: there may be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actual reason to&nbsp;be&nbsp;jealous, but instead of&nbsp;hearing the desired, “I’m sorry. I&nbsp;didn’t think it&nbsp;would hurt you. It&nbsp;won’t happen again...” you keep hearing the same phrase in&nbsp;an&nbsp;agitated tone, “It&nbsp;doesn’t mean anything.” If&nbsp;you find yourself dismissing this and convincing yourself and others that your relationship is&nbsp;strong and healthy but you’re plagued with fears and doubts, then you may need to&nbsp;reconsider some aspects of&nbsp;your relationship.</p><p><h2>3. You can’t stand it&nbsp;when your partner isn’t around.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/620/df1/142fe1504aa4302ff69251651b.jpg><p>It’s quite common to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;spend all of&nbsp;your time with your partner. But it’s important to&nbsp;acknowledge the fact that time spent apart is&nbsp;also valuable. Remember that there are things you can (and sometimes even have&nbsp;to) do&nbsp;on&nbsp;your own. Leave some healthy space between you and your partner if&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;feel like you’re smothering each other.</p><p>Try not to&nbsp;concentrate on&nbsp;negative thoughts like, “What if&nbsp;they’re with someone else?!” Because it’s quite possible that your partner is&nbsp;busy. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;that they’re hanging out with a&nbsp;friend or&nbsp;someone from work, but that’s something that they should neither hide nor ask permission for. Your anxiety won’t change the situation for the better and will definitely only make it&nbsp;worse. Don’t fill all of&nbsp;your free time with thoughts of&nbsp;your partner. Focus on&nbsp;your own responsibilities and things that make you happy and this will lead to&nbsp;your partner being more interested in&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>2. You justify your partner’s terrible behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e8/02e/f39726546b88cb711254ce9e4c.jpg><p>When we’re in&nbsp;love, we&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit blind to&nbsp;anything that’s not perfect about our partner. But it’s worth paying attention to&nbsp;the little things about your partner’s behavior toward you and toward others because what you may not notice through rose-colored glasses could actually be&nbsp;extremely important later on&nbsp;in&nbsp;the relationship.</p><p>If&nbsp;your partner acts kind and attentive toward you on&nbsp;your first date, but he&nbsp;then suddenly starts to&nbsp;shout at&nbsp;the waiter for mixing up&nbsp;the dishes, then this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;warning sign. When the honeymoon phase of&nbsp;your relationship passes, it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;you who ends up&nbsp;having to&nbsp;listen to&nbsp;your partner’s insults when it&nbsp;takes you 20&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;get ready instead of&nbsp;10.</p><p><h2>1. You can’t just say, “No.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83e/30b/1d8b375cebb38548fb79eecc0e.jpg><p>Can you say no&nbsp;to&nbsp;your partner? You don’t have to&nbsp;always accept everything your partner offers. Don’t hesitate to&nbsp;refuse invitations to&nbsp;events that aren’t of&nbsp;interest to&nbsp;you, events that don’t fit your schedule, or&nbsp;requests that you feel are inappropriate. There’s no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;agree to&nbsp;something you don’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;just because you don’t want to&nbsp;offend your partner or&nbsp;because you don’t think your partner will understand your reasons for feeling a&nbsp;certain way. Don’t lose yourself to&nbsp;please another person because, in&nbsp;the end, it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;appreciated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ac/2e5/b480b850eda629fd1e84b0ed10.jpg><p><h2>Bonus: what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;when you feel worried and your emotions are about to&nbsp;take over?</h2></p><p>The psychologist <a href=#>Olga Chizh</a> gives simple advice on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;help yourself when emotions and feelings literally overwhelm you.</p><p>1. Don’t place the responsibility of&nbsp;your emotional state on&nbsp;your partner. You are the only person responsible for&nbsp;it.</p><p>2. Don’t obsess over what your beloved one is&nbsp;doing, what their words meant, how to&nbsp;understand their actions, etc. Don’t let negative fantasies and speculation torment you. Go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the state of&nbsp;being “here and now” more often. It&nbsp;can really help to&nbsp;concentrate on&nbsp;your breathing.</p><p>3. Locate a&nbsp;comfortable place in&nbsp;your body and mentally put an&nbsp;“internal observer” in&nbsp;that area. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;you that will preserve objectivity in&nbsp;any situation and won’t let emotions get the best of&nbsp;you. Look around and see the situation through the eyes of&nbsp;the “internal observer.” If&nbsp;you’re feeling emotionally overwhelmed, remember that those feelings and the feelings that you’re experiencing toward your partner at&nbsp;that moment do&nbsp;not define the entirety of&nbsp;your life.</p><p>4. Look for resources: what can cheer you up&nbsp;and distract from obsessive thoughts about your partner? A&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;coffee, a&nbsp;good film or&nbsp;a&nbsp;book, exercise, a&nbsp;hot bath, a&nbsp;conversation with a&nbsp;friend? Any way to&nbsp;get you out of&nbsp;your head is&nbsp;good.</p><p>If&nbsp;nothing helps and you feel that you can’t get out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;complicated and painful relationship, don’t hesitate to&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional therapist.</p><p>Have you ever experienced an&nbsp;unhealthy emotional dependence in&nbsp;your life?
