Actually, the role of&nbsp;Kevin wasn’t even his first main role: the first main <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a> he&nbsp;had was in&nbsp;<i>Uncle <a href=# title=Buck data-link=tag>Buck</a></i> when he&nbsp;was only 8&nbsp;years old.</li><li>His father used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Broadway</a> actor but when his children were born, he&nbsp;stepped down. When Macaulay was a&nbsp;baby, his family was really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>poor</a>.</li><li>The role of&nbsp;Kevin was almost given to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different boy. If&nbsp;he&nbsp;had gotten&nbsp;it, Kevin would have had dark hair (John Mulaney was asked to&nbsp;audition), and Macaulay’s life would have been much different. But thanks to&nbsp;his experience in&nbsp;<i>Uncle Buck</i>, Culkin was given the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>part</a>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2f/5fe/43f9685907a12b97367d910e3d.jpg><ul><li>The first <i>Home Alone</i> movie got Macaulay the Best Young Actor Starring in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Motion Picture <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>award</a> and he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earned</a> $110,000. Just to&nbsp;compare: for the sequel, he&nbsp;earned $4.5&nbsp;million.</li><li>Of&nbsp;course, this wasn’t easy for Macaulay. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;rest. In&nbsp;his parents’ apartment, he&nbsp;didn’t even have his own bed, let alone his own room.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68d/666/a6d0e15c1cbd3871eccdccf13e.jpg><p>Macaulay during one of&nbsp;his many interviews</p><ul><li>Culkin was one of&nbsp;the most famous children in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;— he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second</a> position on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;the 100 Greatest Kid Stars.</li><li>His father was really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bossy</a>. His mother stayed at&nbsp;home with the other kids and his father went to&nbsp;the shoots with Macaulay. He&nbsp;totally controlled the career of&nbsp;this young star. During the process, Macaulay says, his father wouldn’t let him sleep and made him practice his lines.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac0/2b9/eba46855ffa90e8e655b36398a.jpg><p>Macaulay Culkin is&nbsp;13&nbsp;years old here. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his last roles playing a&nbsp;kid in&nbsp;<i>Getting Even With Dad</i>.</p><ul><li>In&nbsp;1994, Macaulay Culkin did his last film and then he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stopped</a> working in&nbsp;the movie industry. He&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;continue studying at&nbsp;school since, before, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;stop studying because he&nbsp;was working. By&nbsp;that time, he&nbsp;had appeared in&nbsp;15&nbsp;movies in&nbsp;just 7&nbsp;years&nbsp;— not even adult actors can handle this much work. And the movies released after <i>Home Alone</i> were really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heavily</a> criticized, especially <i>The Good Son</i>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f8/677/92b87d5dafa68584ad627b4534.jpg><ul><li>Soon after Macaulay stopped acting, his parents broke up&nbsp;and started <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suing</a> each other over custody. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;take his parents’ names off his trust fund and find an&nbsp;executor that would make sure the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them wouldn’t take any of&nbsp;his money.</li><li>Before coming of&nbsp;age, Macaulay didn’t even know how much money he&nbsp;had earned. His parents made sure he&nbsp;didn’t know all the details of&nbsp;his contracts. Macaulay says, “When I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>turned</a> 18, I&nbsp;sat down in&nbsp;my&nbsp;accountant’s office, it&nbsp;was basically the day where he&nbsp;put down a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;paper in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and said this is&nbsp;how much you’re worth. It&nbsp;was interesting because it&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;these moments where it&nbsp;was like, I&nbsp;felt like this little boy had worked really hard and&nbsp;I inherited all of&nbsp;his money. I&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I inherited this money in&nbsp;some odd way.”</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b92/afe/d554ed5737bc9ec2f5d8a78a7c.jpg><p>Macaulay with his first wife Rachel Miner</p><ul><li>Macaulay <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> married in&nbsp;1998. He&nbsp;and his wife were 18&nbsp;years old. Rachel Miner was also an&nbsp;actress. The <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> didn’t last long and in&nbsp;2000, they broke&nbsp;up.&nbsp;2&nbsp;years later, they got an&nbsp;official <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>.</li><li>In&nbsp;2002, Macaulay started dating <a href=# title="Mila Kunis" data-link=tag>Mila Kunis</a>. Their relationship <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lasted</a> for 8&nbsp;years, and they didn’t really make it&nbsp;public. Mila later said that it&nbsp;was really hard to&nbsp;keep their relationship a&nbsp;secret because Macaulay’s fans were really amazed when they saw him with a&nbsp;girl on&nbsp;the street. The break-up was hard for both of&nbsp;them.</li></ul><ul><li>In&nbsp;2000, Macaulay tried to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;his acting career by&nbsp;appearing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;play and several movies in&nbsp;supporting roles. Some of&nbsp;his work got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>good</a> reviews but despite his talent, none of&nbsp;his work was as&nbsp;popular as&nbsp;<i>Home Alone</i>. From 2000 to&nbsp;2019, he&nbsp;only appeared in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>6&nbsp;movies</a>.</li><li>In&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the 2000s</a>, he&nbsp;had trouble with the law but got away with a&nbsp;fine and a&nbsp;suspended sentence. In&nbsp;2000, his half-sister <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>died</a> and several years later, his sister also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed away</a>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95f/6e1/b58eb3502793f445b090908131.jpg><p>The left photo was taken at&nbsp;the police station when the actor was 24. The right photo was taken around 6&nbsp;months later.</p><ul><li>The actor still doesn’t like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>giving interviews</a> or&nbsp;discussing any aspects of&nbsp;his personal life. It’s understandable: he&nbsp;had enough of&nbsp;it&nbsp;back when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kid. He&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>focus</a> on&nbsp;the present and sometimes talks about the good things in&nbsp;his life.</li><li>In&nbsp;2013, he&nbsp;started a&nbsp;parody rock band called The Pizza Underground but his music career wasn’t very successful&nbsp;— during one of&nbsp;his shows, the audience was really <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disappointed</a>.</li><li>In&nbsp;2018, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Google Assistant commercial where he&nbsp;repeated his role from <i>Home Alone</i> along with some iconic scenes. The commercial went viral and has almost 5&nbsp;million views on&nbsp;YouTube.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ce/651/85feb65fb6a12e5699b60899be.jpg><ul><li>Even though the actor doesn’t talk about his life today, it’s quite obvious that he’s doing fine now. He&nbsp;currently lives with his girlfriend Brenda Song. They have cats, they wear identical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pajamas</a>, and they had a&nbsp;son in&nbsp;2021.</li><li>“People don’t realize how incredibly kind and loyal and sweet and smart he&nbsp;is,” Brenda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>. “Truly what makes Mack so&nbsp;special is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;unapologetically Mack. He&nbsp;knows who he&nbsp;is, and he’s 100 percent okay with that. He’s worked really hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the person he&nbsp;is.”</li><li>In&nbsp;2021, Macaulay took <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>part</a> in&nbsp;<i>American Horror Story</i>. He&nbsp;plays one of&nbsp;the main roles in&nbsp;season 10&nbsp;and his work has gotten a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;very good reviews.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca2/791/7341d351d082ffef30d5fce56a.jpg><p>Macaulay in&nbsp;<i>American Horror Story</i></p><ul><li>In&nbsp;recent years, Macaulay hasn’t been in&nbsp;the spotlight all that much. But he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>splash</a> when he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Gucci show. He&nbsp;looks great at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>age of&nbsp;41</a>&nbsp;and he&nbsp;finally feels great.</li><li>“Yeah, I’m a&nbsp;homebody,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>. “It’s where these 2&nbsp;former child stars, one still working as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;she can, the other not so&nbsp;sure, just want to&nbsp;be. With each other, doing whatever.”</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a65/252/1aed5c585fb7a143f6c33f5e90.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are happy for Macaulay.
