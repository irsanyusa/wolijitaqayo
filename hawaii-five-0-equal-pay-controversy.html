Last week, the Hollywood Reporter reported that Kim and Park were leaving the series after having requested and been denied pay parity with their white co-stars and fellow veteran cast members, Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan. In a Facebook post published on Wednesday, Kim wrote, “CBS and I weren’t able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In a Facebook post published on Wednesday, Kim wrote, “CBS and I weren’t able to agree to terms on a new contract, so I made the difficult choice not to continue.” While Kim did not explicitly address the discussion about pay equity, many interpreted his remark that “the path to equality is rarely easy” as an allusion to the salary dispute.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following Kim’s post about leaving the show, CBS <a href=# rel=noopener>released a statement</a> about both actors’ departure, noting that they were offered “large and significant salary increases.” Series showrunner Peter Lenkov also addressed the matter on his Twitter feed, writing that CBS had offered both actors “unprecedented raises.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>, Kim’s and Park’s final offers were reportedly 10-15% lower than those of O’Loughlin and Caan, who also receive a cut of the series’ back-end deals. Kim and Park have appeared as regular cast members since the show premiered in 2010 and have <a href=# rel=noopener>the same number of episode credits as O’Loughlin and Caan.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Their departure raises new questions about diversity on the show, especially since series regular <a href=# rel=noopener>Masi Oka announced in January that he planned to leave the show</a>. The absence of Kim and Park will result in a complete lack of Asian-American regulars on Hawaii Five-0 for season 8 — which may be perceived as problematic for a show set in a state where the majority of the population <a href=# rel=noopener>claims some Asian heritage</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The conversation takes place against the backdrop of ongoing discussions about the <a href=#>representation</a> of Asian-Americans and the <a href=#>whitewashing</a> of Asian-American roles in Hollywood. It also falls on the heels of <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS’ admission</a> that the network needs to do a better job with the diversity of the casts and <a href=# rel=noopener>showrunners</a> of its series.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kim’s and Park’s decision to leave the series was met with support from the industry, with everyone from <a href=#>Constance Wu</a> to Courtney Love weighing in on the issue.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Others called for O’Laughlin and Caan to stand in solidarity for equal pay in the same manner that the casts of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Big Bang Theory</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Friends</a> did.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Would be nice if there was a united front for pay equality on the part of the some white "allies"?
