Well, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;hard time picturing them together.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>gathered some of&nbsp;the celebrities that went to&nbsp;the same school on&nbsp;this list, just like a&nbsp;class reunion.</p><p><h2>1. Cameron Diaz and Snoop Dogg</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/069/c9d/f04ecf5f0193da892bdff5ccaf.jpg><p>Cameron Diaz and Snoop Dogg attended Long Beach Polytechnic School in&nbsp;California <a href=#>together</a>. “He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;year older than&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;remember him. He&nbsp;was very tall and skinny,” <a href=#>said</a> the actress from The Mask. The rapper also <a href=#>recalled</a> that, back then, he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;hang out with the actress’ cheerleader friends.</p><p><h2>2. Justin Trudeau and Matthew Perry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60e/16c/cf5cb15582adf8d9b14b8ed650.jpg><p>Matthew Perry was born in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, but he&nbsp;was <a href=#>raised</a> in&nbsp;Ottawa. There, his mother worked as&nbsp;the secretary for Pierre Trudeau, <a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>’s prime minister, <a href=#>for</a> 15&nbsp;years. It’s no&nbsp;wonder why the Friends star <a href=#>attended </a>school with the politician’s son and current leader of&nbsp;the country, Justin Trudeau.</p><p><h2>3. Rami Malek, Kirsten Dunst, and Rachel Bilson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd9/1fd/bbc3d35255a26f8652170ae868.jpg><p>Rami Malek and Kirsten Dunst <a href=#>shared </a>the classrooms of&nbsp;the Notre Dame High School, in&nbsp;California. The star of&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody and Mr. Robot <a href=#>recalled </a>that he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;the actress who, by&nbsp;that time, had already appeared in&nbsp;Interview with the Vampire and Jumanji, among other productions. The O.C. star Rachel Bilson also graduated from the same school.</p><p><h2>4. Adam Levine and Jonah Hill</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3a0/024/d4ed935f5b92769e2d6cd9868a.jpg><p>Maroon 5’s lead singer was born almost 5&nbsp;years before Jonah Hill. However, they were <a href=#>neighbors</a> during their teenage years, and even attended the same school in&nbsp;Los Angeles, which made them share a&nbsp;means of&nbsp;transportation. Thus, a&nbsp;great friendship was born. Their bond is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong that Jonah even <a href=#>officiated</a> Adam’s wedding ceremony in&nbsp;Mexico.</p><p><h2>5. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94f/509/ee50e250c0a7b04af6fb53edf5.jpg><p>The Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, located just a&nbsp;few steps away from Harvard University, witnessed one of&nbsp;the most iconic friendships in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;modern <a href=# title=cinema data-link=tag>cinema</a>. <a href=# title="Ben Affleck" data-link=tag>Ben Affleck</a> and Matt Damon <a href=#>met</a> right there, and they already <a href=#>shared</a> the dream of&nbsp;becoming actors at&nbsp;that time. They co-wrote the script of&nbsp;the movie Good Will Hunting.</p><p><h2>6. Robert Downey Jr., Sean Penn, and Charlie Sheen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04d/466/08fddb552590d76b5c1fc87d05.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the early 80s, <a href=#>there was</a> a&nbsp;very popular group of&nbsp;young actors who starred in&nbsp;several teen movies. Some of&nbsp;the members included Robert Downey Jr., Sean Penn, and Emilio Estevez, who were already acting together at&nbsp;Santa Monica High School. There were also a&nbsp;few more big names that <a href=#>attended </a>that school, such as&nbsp;Emilio Estevez’s brother Charlie Sheen and Rob Lowe.</p><p><h2>7. Val Kilmer and Kevin Spacey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/305/153/875dd851ae9ca386ea0d02adaf.jpg><p>Kevin Spacey is&nbsp;<a href=#>only</a> 5&nbsp;months older than Val Kilmer. They were both <a href=#>classmates</a> at&nbsp;Chatsworth High School, in&nbsp;Los Angeles. The actor from Top Gun even <a href=#>suggested</a> that Spacey attend Juilliard School, a&nbsp;prestigious performing arts conservatory in&nbsp;New York, to&nbsp;develop his career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor.</p><p><h2>8. Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman</h2></p><p>Nicole Kidman was born in&nbsp;Hawaii and, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;4, she moved to&nbsp;Australia with her family. She attended North Sydney Girls’ High School, <a href=#>where </a>she met Naomi Watts. The 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them have been <a href=#>friends</a> ever since. In&nbsp;fact, Kidman helped Watts take her first steps in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the cast in&nbsp;the movie Flirting.</p><p><h2>9. Tom Hiddleston, Eddie Redmayne, and Prince William</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b94/bb0/43a1b956c7b494863d1ac15340.jpg><p>Tom Hiddleston and Eddie Redmayne were born less than a&nbsp;year apart and were <a href=#>classmates</a> at&nbsp;Eton College, a&nbsp;boarding school for boys in&nbsp;<a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a>. The actors who <a href=#>incarnated</a> Loki in&nbsp;the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Stephen Hawking in&nbsp;the <a href=#>film </a>The Theory of&nbsp;Everything, respectively, also <a href=#>shared</a> classrooms and rugby practice with Prince William.</p><p><h2>10. Neil Patrick Harris and Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3b/a6c/a6682d5135b9f1f39dae5360d5.jpg><p>Neil Patrick Harris and Freddie Prinze&nbsp;Jr. didn’t work together in&nbsp;<a href=#>any</a> movie or&nbsp;series, but they did go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the same <a href=#>school</a>: La&nbsp;Cueva High School in&nbsp;Albuquerque. There&nbsp;is, of&nbsp;course, a&nbsp;small age difference to&nbsp;consider: the star of&nbsp;How I&nbsp;Met Your Mother graduated in&nbsp;1991, while the actor who played Fred Jones in&nbsp;Scooby Doo finished school in&nbsp;1994.</p><p><h2>11. Gwyneth Paltrow, Jack Black, Liv Tyler, and Kate Hudson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/636/332/23d4bf586da4cefc7dec327218.jpg><p>Surely there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;celebrity stories between the walls of&nbsp;the Crossroads School in&nbsp;Santa Monica, California. Through the years, the college-preparatory school <a href=#>hosted </a>Gwyneth Paltrow, Jack Black, Kate Hudson, and Liv Tyler. Director Michael Bay and Emily and Zooey Deschanel also attended this institute.</p><p><h2>12. Lenny Kravitz, Nicolas Cage, and Slash</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df9/2a3/d4023c5c3f904d21c2cd53a12a.jpg><p>Beverly Hills is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;many Hollywood stars and has only one major public high <a href=#>school</a>, so&nbsp;it’s no&nbsp;surprise that many celebrities attended&nbsp;it. For example, in&nbsp;the early 80s, musician Lenny Kravitz, guitarist Slash (whose real name is&nbsp;Saul Hudson), and actor Nicolas Cage <a href=#>met</a> at&nbsp;this institution.</p><p>Which celebrity would you have wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;school with?
