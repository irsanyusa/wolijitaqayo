In 2020, both <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Crash Landing on You</i> and <i>Itaewon Class</i></a> hooked the attention of large audiences at the start of the year, and the interest in K-dramas only grew as the months wore on. Viewing for the genre on Netflix nearly<a href=# rel=noopener> tripled</a> in the U.S. last year, and the streaming giant <a href=# rel=noopener>recently announced</a> that its investment in Korean content between 2015 and 2020 will total $700 million and include leasing nine stages across two production facilities in Korea. Beyond Netflix, Korean networks continue to produce series which are regularly distributed globally through platforms including the American streaming service Rakuten Viki, Chinese video site iQIYI and Hong-Kong based provider Viu.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A bountiful slate of new series is on the horizon for 2021. They feature actors we have missed on our screens and newcomers who are taking on lead roles for the first time (including, to the great anticipation of many, Jisoo from K-pop phenom <a href=# rel=noopener>BLACKPINK</a>). Many of these shows are helmed by directors and writers who have produced some of the hottest Korean dramas to date, while others are adapted from webtoons that have attracted a significant audience online.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most of the series do not have confirmed launch dates but are planned for release in 2021. Some of the shows will debut on Korean networks like tvN and JTBC, with no confirmed plans for international distribution at the moment. This could change, though, as a growing number of global fans call for Korean dramas to be made available in their countries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here, the most anticipated K-dramas of 2021.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>River Where the Moon Rises</i></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Release date: Feb. 15</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Network: KBS2; will be available on Rakuten Viki</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kim So-Hyun (<i>Love Alarm</i>, <i>The Tale of Nokdu</i>) and Ji Soo (<i>When I Was Most Beautiful</i>, <i>My First First Love</i>) star in this reimagining of the folktale about Princess Pyeonggang and On Dal.
