The latest episode shows the queens performing duets of original music, and Ada has once again pulled out a jaw-dropping performance. She’s clearly the one to beat on this first season of the show.</strong></p><p>Queen of the Universe started with 14 drag queens all vying for the $250,000 grand prize and bragging rights. Now, we are winding down to our final 6 queens, as the competition intensifies. Queen of the Universe is the latest spin-off from RuPaul’s Drag Race. The big difference here is that the queens are not allowed to lip-synch, the greatest singer will be crowned winner.</p><p>Ada continues to leave lasting impressions after each performance. She often blows the judges away with her stage command and vocal ability every time.</p><p>The San Antonio drag queen knows she has something to prove after falling short of winning <a href=#>American Idol</a> in 2018. On Idol she made the Top 10, but here it looks like it is Ada’s time to shine.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/hpOdv47gWhM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ada-vox-continues-to-slay-on-queen-of-the-universe>Ada Vox Continues to Slay on Queen of the Universe</h2><p>Ada’s rendition of “At Last” left the judges in awe. She seemed to have found her groove and is ready to introduce the audience to a new side of her. The side that demands our attention.</p><p>“Good lord!” Judge Vanessa Williams said of her performance. “The growl, the soft approach, the sexiness, just overall presence. You opened your mouth and you changed it.”</p><p>During the show, Williams admitted that “At Last” was an overdone song that she’s come to hate, but after watching Ada’s performance she was “blown away.”</p><p>Fans are loving Ada’s return to the spotlight. She is often the hot topic across social media, with fans constantly sending her encouragement and well wishes.</p><p>In a sneak peak of the latest episode of Queen of The Universe, viewers see Ada shine singing her duet with Aria B. Cassadine. The two light up the stage while performing their original song “Back Off Bitch.”</p><p>The song gives off a Brandy and Monica “The Boy is Mine” vibe. We see the queens battling it out on stage for the affection of the hunk that is tied up on stage. The funky song had the judges bobbing their heads in unison, wishing they had a dance floor to let loose.</p><p>New episodes of <a href=#>Queen of the Universe</a> are available to stream every Thursday.
