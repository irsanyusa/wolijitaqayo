It is also used to describe a person’s profession, <strong>family relationships, personal traits, religious or political affiliation,</strong> and other permanent qualities.</p><p>In other words, ser describes things that do not change about a person or thing.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Yo soy Maureen. (I am Maureen.) This does not change.&nbsp;</li><li>Soy de los EEUU. (I am from the United States.) I cannot change where I am from.</li><li>Es alto. (He is tall.) This might feel confusing because our height does change over time as we grow, but it is a slow change. We can think of this as a permanent<a href=#> physical characteristic</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>La casa de mis padres es grande. (My parents’ house is big.) Again, a permanent condition</li></ul><p>We use estar when we want to describe what something does or is doing. We can think of estar as describing temporary states or actions.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Estoy feliz. (I am happy.) This could change.&nbsp;</li><li>No estoy lista. (I am not ready.) Soon I will be ready.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Él está cansado. (He is tired.) After he rests he will not be tired.</li><li>Está lloviendo. — (It’s raining.) That’s what the weather outside is like right now.<br>When discussing the weather in a broader sense, you can use “ser.” For example, “Alaska es helado” means “Alaska is a cold place,” and “El verano es caluroso” translates to “Summer is hot.”</li></ul><p>We also use “estar” as an auxiliary verb for the progressive tenses in Spanish. To make the present progressive, we combine a form of “estar” with the present participle and we can describe ongoing actions.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>Estoy hablando. – I am speaking.</li><li>Juan está comiendo pizza. – Juan is eating pizza.</li></ul><p>It’s a good idea to learn how to use the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> present progressive in Spanish</a>, as this will help you describe actions still taking place at the moment the person is speaking.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why understanding the difference is important</h3><p>Depending on which verb you use, the meaning of a sentence can drastically shift.</p><p>If you say “Sofía es aburrida,” it means Sofia is always boring, part of her personality. But if you say “Sofía está aburrida,” it means Sofia is feeling bored right now, which could change later.</p><p>See how using the wrong one can totally change what you’re saying?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id='Conjugation-of-the-verb-"ser"-and-the-verb-"estar"'>Conjugation of the verb “ser” and the verb “estar”</h2><p>Before we jump into some examples, let’s take a quick look at the conjugation of ser vs estar.</p><p>Both ser and estar are irregular verbs in Spanish. This means they do not follow the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> regular verb conjugation rules</a>. Memorization time!&nbsp;</p><p>Present tense conjugation of estar vs ser:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=4.5><tr><td><strong>Subject</strong></td><td><strong>Estar</strong></td><td><strong>Ser</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Yo (I)</td><td>Estoy</td><td>Soy&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Tú (You, informal)</td><td>Estás</td><td>Eres&nbsp;</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Él / Ella / Usted (He / She / You, formal)</td><td>Está</td><td>Es</td></tr><tr><td>Nosotros (We)</td><td>Estamos</td><td>Somos</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Vosotros (You, informal plural)</td><td>Estáis</td><td>Sois</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Ellos / Ellas / Ustedes (They / You, formal plural)</td><td>Están</td><td>Son</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id='Different-uses-of-"ser"'>Different uses of “ser”</h2><p>Now, let’s look at some common uses of the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> be-verbs in Spanish</a> to see the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>The acronym<strong> DOCTOR</strong> can help you remember the common uses for the verb ser:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=8><tr><td><strong>Ser</strong></td><td><strong>Examples</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>D</strong>escription (people, animals, objects)</td><td>Soy baja.

(You are happy!)</p><p>Estás triste hoy. (You are sad today.)</p><p>So, we use “estar” when we want to express <strong>emotional states</strong> that won’t last forever.</p><p>We have to also note here that when indicating the location of a <strong>planned event</strong>, we use “ser” instead of “estar,” even though we’re referring to a place.</p><p>So, “la fiesta es en mi casa” (The party is at my house) is the correct form, despite discussing the party’s location.</p><p>Remember ser DOCTOR and estar PLACE. If songs help you remember things, check out this<a href=#> video</a> explaining the different uses of ser and estar.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=More-examples-of-ser-vs.-estar>More examples of ser vs. estar</h2><p>So, we have seen that understanding when to use “ser” versus “estar” in Spanish can be tricky, but examples help clarify their differences.</p><p>Take, for instance, “Ten cuidado, la sopa está caliente” (Be careful. The soup is hot).</p><p>Here, “estar” is used because the temperature of the soup is temporary—it’s hot right now, but it will cool down.</p><p>However, when we talk about gazpacho, we can say “El gazpacho es servido frío” (Gazpacho is served cold).</p><p>Here, “ser” is used because gazpacho is always served cold; its state doesn’t change.</p><p>Another pattern we can mention is ser + de</p><p>“Ser + de” indicates origin, material, or possession, as seen in examples like “Soy de Lima” (I’m from Lima), “El reloj es de plástico” (The watch is made of plastic), and “El reloj es de Susana” (The watch is Susana’s).</p><p>These examples illustrate how “ser” and “estar” are used in various contexts to convey different meanings about a sense of belonging, permanent characteristics and possession.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Common-mistakes><strong>Common mistakes</strong></h2><p>Changing only the verb ser and estar will change the meaning of a sentence. Look at this example:</p><ul><li>Eres aburrido. (You are boring.) Estás aburrido. (You are bored.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ser is used to describe a quality of a person that does not change (You’re boring). Estar is used to describe a temporary situation. (You’re bored right now.)</p><p>Here are more adjectives to be careful with:</p><ul><li>Es rica. (She is rich.) Está rica la comida. (The food is delicious.)</li><li>Soy mala. (I am bad.) Estoy mal. (I am sick.)</li><li>Son atentos. (They are nice.) Están atentos. (They are focused.)</li></ul><p>So, distinguishing between using “ser” and “estar” with adjectives can significantly impact their meaning, as we’ve seen previously with “aburrido/a.”</p><p>Here are some other commonly confused expressions:</p><li>Listo/a</li><p>When using “ser listo/a,” it means to be smart, while “estar listo/a” signifies being ready.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Colin es muy listo. = Colin is very smart. Zoey está lista. = Zoey is ready.</p><li>Bueno/a</li><p>“Ser bueno/a” indicates possessing good quality, whereas “estar bueno/a” means good-looking when referring to people or good-tasting when describing food.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Mi hijo es bueno. = My son is a good person. Ella está muy buena. = She is good-looking. Este churro está bueno. = This churro is good-tasting.</p><li>Orgulloso/a</li><p>Using “ser orgulloso/a” implies being arrogant, while “estar orgulloso/a” denotes being proud.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>Ese chico es demasiado orgulloso. = That boy is too arrogant. Estoy orgullosa de mi trabajo. = I am proud of my work.</p><p>So, the verbs ser and estar will not always translate directly to the verb ‘to be’ in English, just like other<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Spanish verbs have many meanings</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Try not to translate from English to Spanish. It might cause some embarrassing mistakes when talking to Spanish speakers!</p><p>In English, we say: I am hot. In Spanish we say: Tengo calor. (I have heat.)</p><p>We do not use the verb estar here. Estoy caliente means “I am hot under the collar” or “I am hot and bothered” (romantically excited). Yikes. Not something you want to announce to a room full of people.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Get used to the differences of </strong><strong>ser</strong><strong> vs. </strong><strong>estar</strong></h2><p>Take some time to learn the differences between ser and estar. Soon you will feel more<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> confident in speaking Spanish</a>.</p><p>It may feel confusing at first for those trying to learn Spanish and remeber the conjugations of an irregular verb, but once you recognize the general differences and start memorizing some specific uses, the battle of estar vs ser will not feel so difficult.</p><p>There are other pairs of Spanish verbs (such as ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘tener vs haber’</a>‘) where such a distinction is just as vital, so make sure you take advantage of all the great resources and<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> online courses</a> out there to help you master these with ease.</p><p>Also, always remember the acronyms <strong>DOCTOR</strong> (Description, Occupation, Characteristic, Time, Origin, and Relation) for ”ser” and <strong>PLACE</strong> (Position, Location, Action, Condition, and Emotion) for “estar” to draw a line between the common uses.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FAQs</h2><p>Here are also some of the questions Spanish learners ask about Spanish grammar related to the uses of ”ser” and ”estar”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you remember the difference between ser and estar?</h3><p>To remember the difference between the two verbs, it’s helpful to understand that “ser” is used for permanent characteristics or essential qualities when describing people or things, while “estar” is for temporary states or conditions.</p><p>Consistent practice and exposure through learning Spanish can reinforce this understanding over time.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is the difference between “ser feliz” and “estar feliz”?</h3><p>The difference between “ser feliz” and “estar feliz” lies in the permanence of the state. “Yo soy feliz” implies a lasting state of happiness (as in “I’m a happy person”), while “Estoy feliz” suggests a temporary feeling of happiness (“I’m feeling happy”).</p><p>Consistently studying Spanish with a Spanish teacher or language exchange partner and paying attention to context can help grasp this distinction more effectively.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Are “ser” and “estar” used interchangeably?</h3><p>The English verb “to be” can be either “ser” or “estar” but these two verbs are not used interchangeably in Spanish.</p><p>“Ser” is used for defining inherent qualities or characteristics , while “estar” describes conditions, locations, emotions, or actions. So, using the wrong form of the verb “to be” in Spanish can lead to misunderstandings and confusion when talking to native speakers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Which verb is used in “Ella es muy bonita”?</h3><p>In this sentence the verb “ser” is used, indicating a permanent or inherent characteristic. This highlights that “ella” (she) possesses the quality of being very pretty.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What does “Es la una” mean?</h3><p>“Es la una” translates to “It is one o’clock.” Here, “es” is used with the singular form of “la una” (one), indicating the time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summing up: The differences between “estar” and “ser”</h2><p>So, understanding the distinction between these two Spanish verbs is crucial for students learning “ser” and “estar.” These two verbs have distinct meanings based on whether they indicate a temporary state or a permanent condition.</p><p>Being able to conjugate “ser” and “estar” correctly is crucial for effective communication with Spanish speakers, as their usage can significantly alter the intended message.</p><p>Mastering the conjugations of these verbs and their use in context will lead you to a better understanding of Spanish grammar and will help you communicate more confidently with locals in a Spanish-speaking country.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
