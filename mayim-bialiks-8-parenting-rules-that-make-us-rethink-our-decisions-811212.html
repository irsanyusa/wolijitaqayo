1. Her children were nursed until they were older.
Mayim Bialik adopted an unconventional approach to breastfeeding, by allowing her children to nurse as toddlers. Unlike many mothers who aim to wean their children as soon as possible, Bialik let her sons determine when they were ready to stop."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Her children were nursed until they were older.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/01e/6fd/b83294532d8cc7cddc6608b866.png><p>Mayim Bialik adopted an&nbsp;unconventional approach to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>breastfeeding</a>, by&nbsp;allowing her children to&nbsp;nurse as&nbsp;toddlers. Unlike many mothers who aim to&nbsp;wean their children as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible, Bialik let her sons determine when they were ready to&nbsp;stop. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=# title=breastfeeding data-link=tag>breastfeeding</a>, her children exhibited fewer temper tantrums and felt a&nbsp;stronger connection to&nbsp;their mother.</p><p><h2>2. “Please” and “thank you” are not obligatory.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/871/60d/5bacb35bc08be0bc9b3e0c1403.jpg><p>Bialik opted for a&nbsp;different approach in&nbsp;teaching manners to&nbsp;her children, deviating from the traditional method of&nbsp;emphasizing “please” and “thank you.” Instead, she encouraged her children to&nbsp;express gratitude in&nbsp;a&nbsp;more authentic and sincere way, without relying on&nbsp;rote words. She also communicated with her loved ones, making them aware of&nbsp;this decision so&nbsp;they wouldn’t expect the conventional manners from her children. Bialik believes that this approach will help preserve the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>true </a>meaning of&nbsp;appreciation and prevent it&nbsp;from becoming a&nbsp;habit with no&nbsp;true feeling behind&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>3. Her kids receive homeschool education.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b44/987/28fa4058eab4baf2bf3d62da4e.jpg><p>Mayim Bialik has chosen to&nbsp;homeschool her children instead of&nbsp;sending them to&nbsp;a&nbsp;traditional school setting. She believes this approach allows her kids to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grow </a>and learn at&nbsp;their own speed, and fosters their interests while prioritizing creativity and play.</p><p><h2>4. Positive discipline is&nbsp;encouraged.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d6f/4fc/831f0e512da4efbf11e7eba847.png><p>Mayim Bialik subscribes to&nbsp;a&nbsp;parenting approach that prioritizes positive discipline and fosters healthy communication between her and her children. When issues arise, she avoids using aggressive methods like yelling, spanking, time-outs, or&nbsp;scolding. Instead, she opts to&nbsp;calmly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explain </a>the situation to&nbsp;her children using reasoning they can comprehend.</p><p>She believes in&nbsp;treating her kids as&nbsp;she would like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated, as&nbsp;mutual respect is&nbsp;the foundation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong relationship. This method encourages self-discipline and doesn’t instill fear in&nbsp;her children.</p><p><h2>5. She promotes the idea of&nbsp;co-sleeping.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d7/54b/28c04c5bd1ae1caec57ff9bff1.jpg><p>Mayim Bialik practices attachment parenting, which emphasizes closeness between parent and child. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bed-sharing</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;key aspect of&nbsp;this, providing nighttime proximity similar to&nbsp;baby-wearing. Bialik believes it&nbsp;strengthens the relationship, reduces separation anxiety, and leads to&nbsp;longer, better sleep for her children.</p><p><h2>6. She potty trained her children without relying on&nbsp;diapers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6d6/bb1/fe46c250aeb1473e1e25f57c11.png><p>Mayim Bialik’s parenting style includes diaper-free potty training for her children. The approach relies on&nbsp;the idea that babies give signals when they need to&nbsp;use the bathroom. She believes that once the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>signals </a>are recognized, parents simply need to&nbsp;place their child over the potty and give a&nbsp;cue, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sound, for the child to&nbsp;respond&nbsp;to. By&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, she avoids the hassle of&nbsp;changing diapers.</p><p><h2>7. She opts for affordable holiday gifts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/9d7/c386a95e7da3190b2d996f06dd.jpg><p>During the holiday season, Mayim Bialik’s children receive <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gifts </a>from their grandparents, but she and her ex-husband have made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;not give them multiple presents. Instead, they opt for just one toy or&nbsp;practical gifts like socks and pajamas if&nbsp;necessary. The reason for this is&nbsp;because her kids already have all the essentials they need, and she feels it&nbsp;is&nbsp;more important to&nbsp;donate to&nbsp;those in&nbsp;need instead of&nbsp;spending money on&nbsp;expensive presents.</p><p><h2>8. Her children have limited technology access.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/215/16f/857dd95b17924815e6aab3fb57.jpg><p>Mayim Bialik restricts her children’s access to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>technology</a>, including watching&nbsp;TV and movies, to&nbsp;protect their personalities and self-esteem from media influence and peer pressure. The first video her son watched was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>homebirth</a>, to&nbsp;prepare him for his brother’s arrival. He&nbsp;even participated by&nbsp;cutting the cord during the delivery.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about this way of&nbsp;parenting?
