It could be seconds away in your closet.</p><p>Though it's easy to dress up as a fan favorite, we'd suggest going for a spin on some of the popular characters to stand out.</p><p>Here are our top choices for some do-it-yourself "Walking Dead" costumes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Let's start with an obvious one. You can't go wrong with being the show's main guy, Rick Grimes. But change it up a little.</p><p>Season one's sheriff Rick is pretty outdated. Do yourself a favor and grow out your hair and grow a beard, and douse yourself in water to really capture that essence of Rick constantly being drenched in his sweat and tears. After that, splatter yourself with fake blood. If you're going for that no-nonsense Ricktatorship look, you'll want to just get it all over your jacket, clothes, and face for good measure.</p><p>If you're going a bit more traditional, we forgive you. At least make sure you have his signature Colt Python and hatchet handy.</p><p>Regular Rick too amateur for you? Go as Rick from season nine.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A huge time skip at the start of season nine resulted in Rick adapting a grayer, more mature look. The outfit is probably the easiest to pull off since it's a pretty simple jeans and basic button-down.</p><p>Why be Rick when you can be Rark Grames?</p><p>Only the biggest "Walking Dead" fans are going to appreciate this one.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But for those who get the joke, they'll be laughing sideways over this image. The best part? You don't really even need a costume. Just print out this photo and wear it as a mask or slap it on a shirt.</p><p>Naturally, you can't have Rick without fan-favorite, Daryl.</p><p>You can't tote his motorcycle around, but you can find a crossbow and <a href=# id=95ba163d-abb9-56e8-b783-42a6939eaf03>his leather vest</a>. For an older Daryl look, his .</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>There's always Rick's son, one-eyed Carl.</p><p>Carl lost one of his eyes on season six. If you're not into wrapping bandages over your own, upgrade to an eye patch. If you want to be humorous, add this pudding lunch tote to complete the look. It's Carl's favorite snack from season four.</p><p>Rick and Carl wouldn't be anywhere without their leading lady Michonne.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You're going to need a wig and a sweet katana in order to pull off the samurai's look. Fill her pockets with a few candy and protein bars to bring the look together.</p><p><a href=# id=7cba3bf2-e5f0-59f7-9233-483a1c0d764c>Wig, $30, Amazon</a><a href=# id=754d3f30-7966-5e84-9fd9-026316c9dc55>Leather vest, $59, Amazon</a><a href=# id=bed04786-419c-5e8f-a95b-a1272805a411>Green cargo pants, starting at $30, Amazon</a><a href=# id=b3d7e789-9500-5f52-9b8c-3e7c5e3cfbdd>Fold-over black boots, starting at $24, Amazon</a><a href=# id=7e29fbeb-2af8-59c4-8b90-34f856ad08b7>Toy sword, $14, Amazon</a><a href=# id=3fa3d32f-8c14-57cd-8a77-45db5eda990b>Katana sling bag, $25, Amazon</a></p><p>If Michonne's not your girl, go for Carol.</p><p>You'll need a short wig and her military warrior knife. Carol has had a few looks throughout the show. We suggest going for her season six look when going undercover as one of the wolves. You'll need a dark blue raincoat, some face paint or fake blood to draw a "W" onto your forehead, and a bandana to cover your face.</p><p>Don't forget to bake some cookies.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Maybe you want to grow your hair out or get a wig to be Maggie's right-hand man, Jesus.</p><p>Jesus has had a few different looks on the show, but if you're going to be the Hilltop's main man, you're going to need an epic beard and luscious locks. A man bun will do fine, too.</p><p>Jesus has had a few different looks on the show, ranging from a vest to a more relaxed look on season nine with a simple cotton shirt. The item that always stays the same is Jesus' signature trench coat that waves in the wind as he pulls off his ninja moves. Beanie cap optional.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>A Comic-Con favorite is to dress up as the show's villain, Negan.</p><p>Who cares if Negan's in jail right now? That doesn't mean you can't dress up as the character from when he was owning the apocalypse.</p><p>All you need is a black leather jacket, black jeans, a red scarf, and a replica bat, and you're ready to go. You'll also want to slick back your hair. Foul language not necessary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8uinZ6rpK65pnmYZquhnV2srq23yKeeZpyVlrFutMClo6ivlZq7bq%2FOrKuupZWoerq71GaamqZdmbxuxc6uqaydnJt8eL%2FRs6upqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
