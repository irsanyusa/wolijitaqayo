There are in fact many teenagers competing in the 2018 Olympics this year, and many others who have done so in the past. Here’s the lowdown.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How old do you have to be to compete in the Olympics?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to International Olympic Committee rules, there is <a href=# rel=noopener>no specific age</a> limit to compete in the Olympic Games. The age limit depends on the rules set forth by each International Sports Federation. In Kim’s case, for snowboarding, it’s 15, but it varies according to sport.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who are the youngest athletes in the 2018 Olympics?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nope, it’s not Kim. The youngest athlete currently registered for the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics is Wu Meng, a 15 year-old Chinese halfpipe skier. But she’s not the only 15 year-old competing in the Olympics this year. In fact there are five other 15-year-old Olympians this year, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC Sports</a>, and four 16-year-olds. The youngest member of Team USA this year is 17-year-old men’s figure skater Vincent Zhou.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who are the youngest athletes in Olympic history?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Olympic figures</a>, Greek gymnast Dimitrios Loundras is the youngest known medalist.
