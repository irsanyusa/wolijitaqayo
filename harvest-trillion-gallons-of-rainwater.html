In August, Tropical Storm Hilary dropped as much rain on some inland areas of Southern California in a single day as they would typically <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>receive in an entire year</a>. In an age of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Western megadroughts</a> and dangerous <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>decimation of groundwater throughout the country</a>, recent storms underscore the importance of investing in the capacity to manage, collect, and store water.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet much of the national conversation about drought mitigation is going in a different direction. Arizona’s legislature recently&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">called on Congress</a>&nbsp;to explore pumping billions of gallons of water from the Mississippi River to the Colorado. Governments are contemplating&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">major desalination plants</a>. Both approaches are enormously expensive and involve massive logistical, political, and ecological pitfalls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the U.S., there’s strikingly little mainstream discussion of scaling what’s arguably the simplest, cheapest and most sustainable solution for harvesting water: catching it from the sky. The time is ripe for a national policy agenda to dramatically scale up rainwater harvesting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Around the world, humans have been systematically gathering rainwater <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>since ancient times</a>. The technologies are simple: Collect rainwater from rooftops—on homes, warehouses, factories—and send it down gutters into tanks, where it can be filtered and used for domestic purposes, landscaping, or industrial processes. For farms, harvesting rainwater typically means configuring land with slopes and basins that maximize natural irrigation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Recent</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>studies</a> demonstrate that harvesting even a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>small fraction</a> of a percentage of rainwater that falls in a given area can eliminate water shortages for domestic uses while also recharging groundwater. Even when collected rainwater can’t be put to use for drinking or landscaping, it still helps mitigate flood risk from storms. And because there’s no utility needed to transport and sell water that’s collected from a roof, rainwater systems can be less costly than traditional utility equivalents—and avoid the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>carbon emission</a> associated with pumping between locations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For decades, many states and municipalities banned forms of rainwater harvesting for concerns about quality or worries about harvesters taking water from downstream users. But, in recent years,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">state</a>&nbsp;has legalized the practice—owing to a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">growing recognition</a>&nbsp;that collected water can be safely used with filtration and that it contributes substantially to conservation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, despite the shifts in regulation, rainwater harvesting is still mostly the domain of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">off-the-grid subcultures</a>&nbsp;rather than major industrial companies or residential developers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But that’s changing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Apple</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Toyota</a> recently built rainwater harvesting systems at U.S. corporate campuses. A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Ford</a> manufacturing facility now harvests rainwater for plant operations. Because a 50,000 square foot root can collect about 31,000 gallons of water from an inch of rainfall, owners of large warehouses or factories are harnessing economies of scale and driving much of the growth of the practice. In the past several years, cities including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Tucson</a> and Austin have passed some of the nation’s first rainwater collection incentives and requirements, trends that could expand rainwater harvesting among homeowners as well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, the main barrier to wide-scale adoption of rainwater systems is financing the upfront cost of installation. But there are models for how to overcome that barrier. Like installing solar power, installing a rainwater system is a one-time investment that makes it possible to reduce overall utility bills—while meeting other goals like resilience and ecological benefits.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Business and government should look to the success of solar in working to scale-up rainwater harvesting.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Taking cues from renewables legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), states and the federal government should enact tax credits for residential and commercial installations as well as large agricultural projects. Green banks—the mission-driven financial institutions that are proliferating since passage of the IRA—should help provide financing for homeowners and, in particular, affordable housing developers. Governments should install systems on schools and agencies, while advancing their uptake through building codes and other regulations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the biggest advantages of rainwater harvesting as a public policy solution is that it can win bipartisan support. While rainwater can be a popular cause for Democrats concerned with climate resilience, Republicans can advocate rainwater collection without accepting the science of climate change or standing up to fossil fuel lobbyists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In August, when Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy was asked about the GOP’s plans for addressing climate change, he spoke about a proposal—backed by former President Donald Trump—for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">planting one trillion trees</a>.&nbsp; While the approach has been justifiably criticized by scientific experts for distracting from the necessary work of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it nonetheless offers a glimmer of hope that there can be some element of bipartisan action on the environment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Republicans and Democrats should come together to mobilize government and business toward a common goal: build the capacity to harvest a trillion gallons of rainwater annually.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s ambitious, but—combining diverse residential, industrial, and agricultural projects, and drawing on the collective participation of homeowners, companies, financial institutions, municipalities, states, and the federal agencies—it’s achievable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As recent events demonstrate, we’re entering an era not just marked by scarce water—but wildly unpredictable water. We need a bold but practical plan to adapt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2FmgHd%2FjqGYq66VqMFuwNGio6Whn6N6qK3Lpaanq12ks26%2BwKKlsJmkmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
