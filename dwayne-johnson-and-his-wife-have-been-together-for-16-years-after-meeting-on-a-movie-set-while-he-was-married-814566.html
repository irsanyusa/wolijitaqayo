Sometime later, the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> that he&nbsp;felt <a href=# title=depressed data-link=tag>depressed</a> and lost: “Around 2008, 2009, I&nbsp;was going through a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;personal stuff. I&nbsp;was struggling. Struggling to&nbsp;figure out what kind of&nbsp;father&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;be. I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I had done a&nbsp;bad job cultivating relationships and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends had fallen by&nbsp;the wayside. I&nbsp;was scared.”</p><p>At&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;and his ex-wife <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a> that they were important in&nbsp;each other’s lives and would continue to&nbsp;work together on&nbsp;their business interests and philanthropic endeavors. In&nbsp;addition, they pledged to&nbsp;raise their daughter Simone Alexander as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving team.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was lucky enough to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love for a&nbsp;second time.</h2></p><p>The Rock <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> that falling in&nbsp;love again would be&nbsp;difficult in&nbsp;his position. He&nbsp;met Lauren Hashian on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the 2006 movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Game Plan</i></a>. And although Johnson was married at&nbsp;the time and didn’t feel an&nbsp;immediate connection, life had a&nbsp;path in&nbsp;store for them together in&nbsp;the future.</p><p>After his divorce, Dwayne reunited with Lauren Hashian, and they began dating in&nbsp;2007. Since then, their love has only grown and strengthened. The couple has gone through difficult times together, such as&nbsp;the loss of&nbsp;Johnson’s father in&nbsp;2020, but they have always found a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;support each other and move forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6a4/574/da3afe54168cdfb317c104c0d7.jpg><p>The Rock and Lauren Hashian <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> in&nbsp;August 2019, after welcoming their first daughter, Jasmine, in&nbsp;2015 and their second daughter, Tiana, in&nbsp;2018. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Johnson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about the experience of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;house full of&nbsp;strong, tough women, “It’s scary, but it’s amazing.”</p><p>Johnson has mentioned on&nbsp;several occasions the importance of&nbsp;his home life and how his relationship with Hashian has been instrumental in&nbsp;finding balance. For him, both home and his family are a&nbsp;fundamental part of&nbsp;his success, and he&nbsp;believes it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;strong home life to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;other aspects.</p><p>The couple is&nbsp;very open about their love and admiration for each other, and they share intimate moments of&nbsp;their lives on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>. In&nbsp;their posts, you can see how supportive they are of&nbsp;each other in&nbsp;their personal and professional endeavors. In&nbsp;one Instagram post, Johnson shared a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;Hashian and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “I&nbsp;set the tone and tempo, but she’ll always be&nbsp;the life anchor who makes this whole thing happen and shine.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;is&nbsp;not afraid to&nbsp;show himself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tender soul.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/369/596/76030d51d3872ea3fe81625aa6.jpg><p>The Rock is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>proud father</a> of&nbsp;three daughters: Simone Alexandra, from his previous marriage to&nbsp;Dany García, and Jasmine and Tiana Gia, from his current marriage. When talking about fatherhood, he&nbsp;emphasizes that the most important thing is&nbsp;simply to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for them, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tender and gentle. The actor who grew up&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;masculinity, even with all the weight of&nbsp;fame, strives to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;attentive and loving father.</p><p><h2>For Lauren, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most attractive man in&nbsp;the world, but beyond that, he&nbsp;knows how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;good and bad times.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cb/373/3f55a05bdabb320645a5a248f3.jpg><p>Dwayne Johnson’s wife has been his unconditional support in&nbsp;good times and bad. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>According to</a>&nbsp;Johnson, his wife has always considered him the most handsome man in&nbsp;the world, long before he&nbsp;was named as&nbsp;such by&nbsp;<i>People</i> magazine. His love has been a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;emotional support in&nbsp;all aspects of&nbsp;life, including his career and his relationship with his family.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most difficult moments of&nbsp;his life, when his father passed away, she was also there lending her support. On&nbsp;her Instagram account, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “Your son has one heck of&nbsp;an&nbsp;angel now watching over him. And without you, his path would’ve been a&nbsp;very different one. How lucky to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;father and grandfather to&nbsp;pass on&nbsp;their family business and the culture and the work ethic, and carry that torch with the greatest respect and honor for what you did before him.”</p><p>The Rock is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who has <a href=#>proven to</a>&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated father and husband. Despite his demanding career, Lauren Hashian, his wife, has been his unwavering support since the beginning of&nbsp;their relationship.</p><p>Their story is&nbsp;an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;how love and emotional support are critical to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lasting and happy relationship, regardless of&nbsp;fame. From the moment Johnson and Hashian began their relationship, they have validated each other. They have been together for almost 16&nbsp;years now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLG4rdinnGain527tLvNZpinnF2dtrR51qKdnmWYlsOmecGenKdlpKS0psDHnqlmnp%2BnenKCjLKcmqqjYq6nwMSrZKadlam2r7OMqKVmmV2ivLe1xGaqnqxdrLWquMRmn55lp5bAbrnAq6minZRihXKAlG9taA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
