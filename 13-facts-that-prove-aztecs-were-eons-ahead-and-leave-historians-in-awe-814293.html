Far from being a&nbsp;small ethnic group, they established a&nbsp;grand empire adorned with magnificent monuments. This vast domain was governed efficiently through a&nbsp;sophisticated system resembling modern-day governmental structures in&nbsp;many countries. Undeniably, the Mexica, also known as&nbsp;the Aztecs, demonstrated remarkable advancements in&nbsp;various fields, surpassing the achievements of&nbsp;their European counterparts during that era.</p><p><h2>1. These two edible products were worth more than gold.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a1b/8e6/5a59d3527d88b2f65e1fe86bc7.jpg><p>Despite not having an&nbsp;official currency, trade was vital to&nbsp;Aztec society. The established payment system was barter, the exchange of&nbsp;goods. Both corn and cocoa were essential when trading. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Corn</a> was the basis of&nbsp;Aztec gastronomy.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;its multiple uses and properties, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cacao</a> was considered a&nbsp;luxury. It&nbsp;also had the bonus of&nbsp;being easy to&nbsp;transport and count, allowing for pre-established payment prices. For example, a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;fruit could be&nbsp;“bought” for one cacao seed, while a&nbsp;rabbit would cost about ten seeds and a&nbsp;blanket between 65&nbsp;and 100&nbsp;seeds.</p><p><h2>2. Hygiene, both personal and public, was very important.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd0/e3c/a4ab465afd8f2abbdfe410c271.jpg><p>The city streets were swept daily, and the Aztecs also created <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>complex systems</a> for waste disposal. The objective was to&nbsp;pollute their environment as&nbsp;little as&nbsp;possible, especially the <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a>. The Aztecs bathed daily and used natural products such as&nbsp;soap, scrubs, perfumes, and deodorants.</p><p>There was a&nbsp;highly developed awareness of&nbsp;the importance of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>personal hygiene</a>. They also took care of&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>buccal health</a>. They used a&nbsp;product similar to&nbsp;what we&nbsp;know today as&nbsp;chewing gum to&nbsp;clean their teeth and freshen their breath.</p><p><h2>3. They developed complex measurement systems.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c3/caa/2002d150f59b5a6c7622f12303.jpg><p>It&nbsp;would have been impossible for them to&nbsp;build those great temples, houses, or&nbsp;palaces without having a&nbsp;measurement system to&nbsp;help them accurately calculate each part of&nbsp;their architectural constructions. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;creating their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mathematical system</a>, they developed different measurement codes.</p><p>The most popular is&nbsp;that of&nbsp;time, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Aztec calendar</a> of&nbsp;365&nbsp;days, which is&nbsp;very similar to&nbsp;the Gregorian calendar that we&nbsp;use internationally. But they also developed a&nbsp;system of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>length</a> measurements similar to&nbsp;our metric system, which, when studied in&nbsp;depth by&nbsp;mathematicians, proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very accurate, having only, in&nbsp;some cases, small margins of&nbsp;error.</p><p><h2>4. Modern languages have inherited many words from the Aztecs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcf/3cf/bf972857e4a989e9b2eff8f6a6.jpg><p>“Guacamole,” “tomato,” and “<a href=# title=avocado data-link=tag>avocado</a>” are just some of&nbsp;the most famous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Aztec words</a> that we&nbsp;use daily and that come from Nahuatl, the Aztec language. Modern Spanish has an&nbsp;extensive list of&nbsp;words coming from Nahuatl because when conquistadors arrived in&nbsp;Aztec lands, they discovered many new products, especially plants and other edibles. Having never seen them before, they did not know what to&nbsp;call them, so&nbsp;they kept the exact words used by&nbsp;the indigenous people.</p><p><h2>5. They had community midwives who provided pregnancy advice to&nbsp;an&nbsp;expecting mother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b86/f39/f4552b544f8bd546c84c54de93.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Aztec civilization, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>tlamatlquiticitl</i></a> were skilled midwives who provided pregnant women medicinal, emotional, and spiritual care. They visited expectant mothers regularly, offering treatments if&nbsp;needed.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Florentine Codex</a> contains their advice, such as&nbsp;avoiding frightening or&nbsp;angering sights and refraining from late-night walks to&nbsp;prevent excessive crying in&nbsp;the child. They also cautioned against daytime naps, which were believed to&nbsp;affect the child’s eyelids. <i>Tlamatlquiticitl</i> played a&nbsp;vital role in&nbsp;ensuring the well-being of&nbsp;mothers and infants during pregnancy and childbirth.</p><p><h2>6. They read newborns horoscopes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e5/94c/78cc005a8886aca14ca4c2ded5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the Aztec civilization, newborns underwent a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;carefully orchestrated birth <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rituals</a> aimed at&nbsp;endowing them with a&nbsp;soul, determining their destiny, and establishing a&nbsp;connection between the child and the gods. These rituals included passing them over a&nbsp;fire, consulting their horoscope, presenting them to&nbsp;the gods, and, in&nbsp;some communities, drawing a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;the child’s blood.</p><p>Like Chinese and Western <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>astrology</a>, the Aztecs believed stars and constellations influenced a&nbsp;person’s character traits and fortune. They utilized a&nbsp;shorter calendar of&nbsp;260 days for the zodiac signs, with each sign lasting 13&nbsp;days, resulting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;20&nbsp;signs.</p><p><h2>7. Parents didn’t name their babies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/374/e57/42596b53b190dd1c1bcb737765.jpg><p>Joy and celebration preceded a&nbsp;baby’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arrival</a> in&nbsp;Aztec society. But to&nbsp;name this new family member, the parents or&nbsp;the midwife first had to&nbsp;inform the priests exactly when the baby was born. With this information, the priests would consult the Aztec calendar to&nbsp;know under what sign he&nbsp;was born and his future <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>omen</a>.</p><p>The priests would name them as&nbsp;they saw fit based on&nbsp;all this information. The baby’s name would be&nbsp;shared publicly a&nbsp;few days later during a&nbsp;ceremony that would take place in&nbsp;the family home, similar to&nbsp;what we&nbsp;know as&nbsp;a&nbsp;baptism. Citlalli, Tenoch, Izel, Zuma and Yaretzi are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>traditional</a> Aztec names.</p><p><h2>8. The social class to&nbsp;which you belonged was made clear.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d4/923/7b0820555d80bbe03a86d147d7.jpg><p>Aztecs followed a&nbsp;strict <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>protocol</a> regarding clothing, hairstyle, and <a href=# title=accessories data-link=tag>accessories</a>. These were directly linked to&nbsp;their status or&nbsp;role in&nbsp;society. Peasants wore a&nbsp;loincloth called <i>maxtlatl</i>, while nobles, priests, and high-ranking warriors could also wear the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>tilma</i></a>, a&nbsp;rectangular blanket worn differently. Only the higher social classes wore shoes.</p><p>Peasant women also wrapped a&nbsp;rectangular blanket called <i>cueitl </i>around their waists. They then fastened it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;rope or&nbsp;belt to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;skirt. Inside their homes, they didn’t cover their breasts, but when they went out, they wore a&nbsp;camisole called a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>huipil</i></a>. The nobles were the only ones with the privilege of&nbsp;wearing the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>quechquemitl</i></a>, a&nbsp;poncho-like garment that fell down the front and back in&nbsp;a&nbsp;triangular shape.</p><p><h2>9. They allowed mobility between social classes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d19/ac5/136b1c5ed6865cdaea67a85b32.jpg><p>Aztec society was divided into three large social groups: the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>pipiltin</i></a>, who, although not the most powerful, were the most privileged class; the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>macehualtin</i></a>, the “common” people of&nbsp;the town, the plebs; and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>tlātlācohtin</i></a>, the poorest social group, made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;criminals, prisoners of&nbsp;war or&nbsp;people who because of&nbsp;their debts were servants.</p><p>Interestingly, while in&nbsp;other societies, people were born wealthy or&nbsp;poor and, in&nbsp;many cases, that lasted a&nbsp;lifetime, in&nbsp;Aztec culture, everyone could climb or&nbsp;descend in&nbsp;status. They thought that everything and everyone had their proper place in&nbsp;the universe, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;moral duty to&nbsp;find their own, hence the possibility that everyone, by&nbsp;their own merits, could change their social class.</p><p><h2>10. Both men and women had plenty of&nbsp;different hairstyles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffc/051/7d98a65159862c73602215697a.jpg><p>Both men and women cared for their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hair</a> and adorned it&nbsp;with jewelry, ribbons, or&nbsp;elaborate headdresses. The men mostly wore bangs and shoulder-length hair, while the warriors wore their hair in&nbsp;ponytails or&nbsp;shaved it&nbsp;off, leaving long locks in&nbsp;high ponytails or&nbsp;braided and decorated in&nbsp;different ways.</p><p>Women generally had long, loose hair, but they braided it&nbsp;on&nbsp;special occasions. However, the female companions of&nbsp;the warriors could be&nbsp;easily distinguished from the rest since they had shorter hair.</p><p><h2>11. Body paint was more than just a&nbsp;“fashion”.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/119/fed/36c8ed56f7a60b894a37ae6355.jpg><p>Colors held significant value in&nbsp;the Aztec civilization, and among the most important was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blue turquoise</a>, reflecting the hues of&nbsp;water bodies and the daytime sky. Body paint played a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;Aztec society, particularly during <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>battles</a> and among military orders.</p><p>For instance, the <i>cuauhchiqueh</i>, a&nbsp;military order, displayed their status with blue paint on&nbsp;one half of&nbsp;their heads and red or&nbsp;yellow on&nbsp;the other. Using vibrant body paint was widespread throughout <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mesoamerica</a> and held cultural and symbolic importance for the Aztecs.</p><p><h2>12. They had very advanced knowledge of&nbsp;medicine.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd8/9e3/0b3e585ff1955af2813f8bc2d1.jpg><p>The Aztecs are among the pre-Hispanic cultures most noted for their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>healing techniques</a>, treatments, and extensive knowledge of&nbsp;botany and healing plants. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;stopping infections and suturing wounds with hair, they could also heal broken bones with immobilization techniques or&nbsp;extract dental pieces almost painlessly using natural anesthetics.</p><p>The effective way the Aztecs treated illnesses and healed wounds attracted the attention of&nbsp;the conquistadors, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>preferred</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated by&nbsp;indigenous doctors rather than by&nbsp;European doctors.</p><p><h2>13. They were forerunners in&nbsp;what we&nbsp;know today as&nbsp;saunas.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f35/a65/186c8055d58f51aff98bc2a2ac.jpg><p>The <i>temazcales</i>, a&nbsp;name in&nbsp;the Aztec language that means “sweat house,” were buildings used for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>steam baths</a> with hot stones, similar to&nbsp;what we&nbsp;know as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sauna. These types of&nbsp;baths were part of&nbsp;the daily routine of&nbsp;personal hygiene.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;maintaining cleanliness, it&nbsp;had medicinal use since it&nbsp;was used to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>treat</a> different ailments when combined with medicinal herbs. At&nbsp;the same time, they also had religious use. The steam was believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like a&nbsp;divine breath that purified both the physical and spiritual body.</p><p>Each <a href=#>ethnic</a> group possesses unique traditions and rituals that they proudly embrace.
