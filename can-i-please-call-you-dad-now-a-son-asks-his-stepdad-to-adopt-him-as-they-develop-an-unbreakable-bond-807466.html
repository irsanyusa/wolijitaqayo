However, a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;tragic events brought them back together, and they have been going strong ever since. While they were apart, Sarah had a&nbsp;child with another man, a&nbsp;little boy named Connor.</p><p>Derek first met Connor on&nbsp;Christmas Eve in&nbsp;2016. They clicked right away after spending the night together, to&nbsp;the point where little Connor was crying and didn’t want to&nbsp;leave.</p><p>Their connection was instant; Derek <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that over the next few months, they developed such a&nbsp;strong bond that they couldn’t get enough of&nbsp;each other, constantly talking and meeting&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>Connor wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Derek’s son ever since the beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/124/92f/74277b53b9991449879bcc6400.jpg><p>As&nbsp;time went&nbsp;by, they felt like an&nbsp;actual family, with Connor picturing Derek as&nbsp;his own father. Derek still recalls a&nbsp;day in&nbsp;the car when the little boy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke up</a>&nbsp;while staring at&nbsp;him, saying, <strong>“Can I&nbsp;call you dad?”</strong></p><p>Derek confesses that he&nbsp;panicked for a&nbsp;few minutes before answering the question because he&nbsp;couldn’t think of&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;say. He&nbsp;told Connor that he&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;his mother about the decision because it&nbsp;was not entirely his. When they got home, however, Sarah reassured Derek that the kid <a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> him so&nbsp;much that she was fine with it&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was ready.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db5/7f9/5a66795977b1b695c61ab5081f.jpg><p>A&nbsp;week later, the scene was repeated, with Connor saying, “Can I&nbsp;please call you dad now?” Derek <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, asking if&nbsp;he&nbsp;really wanted that. And Connor said, “<strong>More than anything else in&nbsp;the world!</strong>” Since then, Connor has addressed him as&nbsp;“dad.”</p><p>They’ve walked hand in&nbsp;hand through Connor’s entire life path, from his first day of&nbsp;school to&nbsp;their first baseball game together. Derek asked him for permission to&nbsp;marry his mother, and they finally tied the knot in&nbsp;2019, with Connor serving as&nbsp;Derek’s best man.</p><p><h2>After a&nbsp;few setbacks, the family expands.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab2/6a4/7bd8915987a23ec135958ed79f.jpg><p>Aside from being emotionally tied as&nbsp;father and son, they both desired to&nbsp;be&nbsp;legally linked, as&nbsp;Connor had frequently requested to&nbsp;change his last name to&nbsp;Derek’s, writing it&nbsp;everywhere, even at&nbsp;school.</p><p>He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> categorically: “Well, of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;want your last name. But I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;officially be&nbsp;your son.<br><strong>You are my&nbsp;dad!</strong>” When they got to&nbsp;this point, Sarah and he&nbsp;began the adoption process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b9/0c7/a48da35a848be72987bea26e2f.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Derek and his wife were attempting to&nbsp;conceive a&nbsp;child and expand their family, but that joy didn’t come without effort. After a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;negative tests and fertility treatments, they agreed to&nbsp;try one more time and give up&nbsp;if&nbsp;nothing worked.</p><p>That last time was the one. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;hot <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>August</a> day in&nbsp;2019, Sarah popped out while Derek was working in&nbsp;the garage, announcing that they were finally pregnant. Everly was born in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>April</a> of&nbsp;the following year, bringing a<strong>&nbsp;load of&nbsp;joy and love to&nbsp;the wonderful family.</strong></p><p><h2>They took to&nbsp;social media to&nbsp;share their special bond.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f2/155/541db45c8d979f6781f8b790a2.jpg><p>Derek and Connor have always found humor in&nbsp;everything they&nbsp;do, so&nbsp;they thought it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;fun to&nbsp;share their<strong> special father-son relationship on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>.</strong> They began posting videos of&nbsp;their pranks, bloopers, or&nbsp;them just being themselves on&nbsp;<a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a>. They have grown in&nbsp;popularity day by&nbsp;day until they went viral.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/967/9d2/c9d45e575eac78379c33922d35.jpg><p><strong>Connor and Derek now have over 115,000 followers on&nbsp;their TikTok account</strong>, known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>BadicalDadical</i></a><i>.</i> This new hobby of&nbsp;theirs has heightened their bond even further, allowing them to&nbsp;travel together and meet new people.</p><p><h2>The long-awaited day arrives.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d5/991/c505235d489635604c3c424d5f.jpg><p>While Everly was dealing with a&nbsp;serious health problem, the family was also going through the adoption process. Connor had asked Derek several times over the years why he&nbsp;couldn’t be&nbsp;adopted, and despite the difficulty of&nbsp;the procedure, Derek had always vowed to&nbsp;make that dream come true one day.</p><p><strong>Derek had promised himself, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;better father than the one he&nbsp;had,</strong> one who is&nbsp;involved in&nbsp;his son’s daily activities. That’s why he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;adopt Connor and raise him as&nbsp;his son, but he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;fulfill one important step first: get Connor’s biological father’s permission.</p><p>Derek remembers their meeting fondly, saying that they talked for over 3&nbsp;hours. He&nbsp;recognized Derek’s kindness toward Connor and agreed to&nbsp;the adoption. That day was the happiest for their family, and when Derek told him the news, Connor did nothing but cry and hug him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dba/a79/885960577899d12ab2b9f301db.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>On&nbsp;April&nbsp;2, 2021</a>, the adoption day arrived, and it&nbsp;was not as&nbsp;they had hoped or&nbsp;planned for, but Derek and Connor didn’t mind, and after hearing the good news over the phone, all they cared about was finally realizing their dream.</p><p>Derek finally had the opportunity to&nbsp;tell Connor that he&nbsp;was his son for life. In&nbsp;every way, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Julian. Although the road to&nbsp;this point was difficult, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was hard to&nbsp;answer the many queries about adoption, Derek recognizes that every effort was worthwhile. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reflects</a> emotionally: “<strong>He&nbsp;was my&nbsp;son the first time he&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;call me&nbsp;dad.”</strong></p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, Connor never gave up&nbsp;on&nbsp;his dream of&nbsp;being adopted, always striving to&nbsp;encourage his future father to&nbsp;keep going. <strong>“Don’t give up&nbsp;hope, Dad, and keep fighting</strong>,<strong> because we&nbsp;will win!”</strong></p><p>Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;stepparent?
