Automakers are scrambling to meet electric vehicle adoption targets set forth by the Biden administration that some companies say are too aggressive. Other industry officials have noted that the charging infrastructure is not yet widely available, and automakers are quickly adopting Tesla’s North American Charging Standard to ensure consumers have somewhere to “fill” up. "><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Other industry officials have noted that the charging infrastructure is not yet widely available, and automakers are quickly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>adopting</a> Tesla’s North American Charging Standard to ensure consumers have somewhere to “fill” up.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Recently, seven automakers committed to a joint venture in the United States with a goal to install 30,000 chargers that will include both the NACS and the Combined Charging System, in a direct challenge to Tesla’s charging network dominance.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the list of available charging options in the future is growing longer, concerns related to charging access are still high, even among EV owners, new Morning Consult data shows.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>EV owners are worried about charging access, mileage and wait times</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Concerns about access to charging stations are widespread among those who own EVs (62%). The bulk of EV and Tesla owners also cited concerns about access to their preferred charging station, their vehicles’ mileage range and wait times at charging stations.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Charging could also be a sticking point for potential EV buyers, with many having expectations for a mileage range that -- at least for now -- are unrealistic based on the current market.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">About a quarter of consumers who are likely to purchase an electric vehicle in the next 12 months or five years said they want EVs to have a minimum range of 500 miles or more on a single charge, which is roughly 200 miles above the record average <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>set</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Consumer reports</a> that reference Environmental Protection Agency data show that the 2023 Lucid Air is the only EV in the United States that has an estimated range higher than 500 miles, with a starting price tag over $100,000 — although the company also offers a model with a range above 400 miles under that price point. Other EV models, including several Tesla vehicles and electric pickup trucks from Rivian and Ford, have ranges that vary between 300 and 400 miles, which roughly 3 in 10 potential EV buyers cited as their ideal minimum charging range in the survey. These vehicles have price tags starting around $50,000 or higher.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Although a substantial number of EV owners have concerns about charging access, 3 in 5 said they always have charging access available where they park at home. That share drops drastically for consumers looking to purchase an EV in one year (31%) and in five years (26%).&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">About 2 in 5 hybrid owners always have access available where they park at home, which could potentially make a switch to an EV easier in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>EV owners support automakers’ moves to adopt Tesla’s charging standard</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Some automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Rivian, appear to be attempting to mitigate EV owners’ concerns about charging access by joining Tesla’s Supercharger network. These partnerships are a welcome change for EV owners, with 83% saying the endeavors are a good move for the industry, likely because a large majority of them said they have a Supercharger accessible to them. Around 3 in 4 hybrid owners and potential EV buyers also said the Tesla Supercharger adoption is a good thing.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While EV owners broadly support the agreement between automakers and Tesla on the use of the latter’s Superchargers, about 3 in 5 are also concerned about vehicles other than Teslas using the chargers, which could increase wait times and reduce access to chargers away from home.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>A reliable network, expanded range are key to help quell potential buyers’ charging concerns</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The name of the game is charging access, and automakers are scrambling to make sure they can provide it to current and potential customers. With the latest news about seven automakers – GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis – setting up a joint venture to install 30,000 chargers in urban areas and along highways, consumers might feel a little less worried about finding a place to park and charge.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But automakers will still need to figure out a way to temper the expectations of an affordable 500-mile range EV. More than a quarter of potential EV buyers are expecting high mile ranges, and there are more EVs that are quickly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>creeping</a> into the 300-mile per charge range, but consumers will always want more.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Meanwhile, the first charging stations aren’t expected to open until next summer and automakers that have chosen to adopt the Supercharger technology won’t have it available in their vehicles until 2025, although they will provide adapters starting next year.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to raise interest rates could provide some downtime for automakers to get their charging networks up and running. The higher rates will make it more difficult for car buyers to secure auto loans, and while new and used EV prices are dipping slightly, it might not be enough to encourage consumers to purchase.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6mytLjAZqquqJWnsKmt0aCcq6tdmsNur8eaqaChnpx6pLvNnJyrpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
