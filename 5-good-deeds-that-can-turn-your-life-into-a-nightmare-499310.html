We have analyzed <a href=#>stories</a> from Internet users about situations where their good intentions led to something bad. From these, we've made five types of <a href=# title="good deeds" data-link=tag>good deeds</a> that people usually regret.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> will tell you about the good deeds that you should really be careful of unless you want to turn your life into a nightmare.</p><p><h2>Giving away things for free.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d9/c1c/d5722b510dbd9172ff77005f02.jpg><p>We are not trying to make you turn your home into a place where there are a lot of useless things. Helping other people is good. However, when you post an ad about something you are ready to give away for free, you should be ready to see a lot of crazy requirements and complaints.</p><p>For example, this <a href=#>man</a> posted an ad about giving away his huge fish tank. He said that he couldn't help with the transportation because after he injured his back, he wasn't allowed to pick up heavy things. Despite this, some people wanted him to get the tank to their place to another city, and others wanted him to present them with a fish.</p><p>The man tried to be polite but in the end, he ran out of patience and decided to sell the tank at a cheap price. He found a buyer very soon: a father wanted to present the tank to his daughter. He just came and picked it up and a few weeks later and sent photos of the filled tank.</p><p>As you have already understood,<strong> it's safer to not give your things away to strangers on the Internet, but instead, try to sell them, maybe even at a really low price</strong>. Of course, there may be problems, too: people will definitely try to negotiate the price trying to seem poorer than they really are.</p><p>There are also other options. You can bring the thing you don't need to a charity organization, or if your local laws and rules allow, you can just leave it outside of your apartment building or house where someone can pick it up. For example, in some countries, people do this with furniture.</p><p><h2>Loving those who aren't ready to be in a serious relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/49a/7aa/58f20d5ede8fce1e09c858e0f8.jpg><p>People who claim that they are not ready for a serious <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> don't lie, they just don't tell you that it's <strong>you</strong> who they are not ready to have a relationship with. Maybe you've already noticed that some people who previously didn't want to have a family have one right after they break up with someone. And their previous relationship could have been going on for years.</p><p>Unconditional <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> is great but only if both partners have it. Don't waste your time and energy on trying to make someone happy if you realize that they are with you only because they are waiting for a better option. No matter how painful it is, there is no use sitting and waiting to be loved.</p><p>Never beg anyone to start a serious relationship with you. If this person loves you, they will do it anyway. <strong>Remember that you deserve much more than, "I guess."</strong></p><p><h2>Helping people who don't want help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/115/2c8/a2f7925acf9205f5f81613a762.jpg><p>Unfortunately, many people have been in situations where their relatives or friends are in trouble but they refuse to admit it even if it is destroying their lives. What should you do in a situation like this? Of course, nobody wants to leave their friends and family but you have to understand that whatever you do, it might be useless.</p><p><strong>No matter how much you try, if a person doesn't want your help, you are wasting your time.</strong> It's hard to accept especially if you are trying to get someone away from a bad situation, but all you can do here is hope that the person will change their mind and accept your help before it's too late.</p><p><h2>Lending money to those who are used to living at the expense of others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/175/a91/3ba2f2545f869a43279fff1f10.jpg><p>If a person is in a really hopeless situation, you should try to help them. But there is a certain type of person who gets into trouble pretty regularly and it doesn't seem like they're trying to solve their problems, hoping for the help of their friends and family. And if you lend money to such a person, there is a good chance that you won't get it back.</p><p>It's easy to recognize such people. Try asking for your money back and you will be hated. They will try to make you feel as if you are a heartless monster. <strong>So, if someone asks you for money to borrow, you should lend them an amount you are comfortable not getting back.</strong> And of course, don't help anyone if it puts you in danger.</p><p><h2>Trying to please everyone.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e0/047/98c4605734921734be9765956d.jpg><p>There is nothing wrong with trying to please someone you're close to. However, there is a chance that you'll regret it. Firstly, you can't always please everyone. And secondly, if you try to please someone, you might lose yourself in the process.</p><p>Be aware of someone trying to change your behavior, lifestyle, or appearance. Most likely, this person is a <a href=# title=manipulator data-link=tag>manipulator</a> who will make you "perfect" (besides, they will be unhappy even if you become their "ideal" person). Don't follow what these people say because they are probably really selfish.</p><p><strong>If you don't have a healthy level of selfishness in situations concerning your health, time, life goals, and hobbies, you won't be able to give anything to other people.</strong> If you have healthy self-esteem and don't let other people cross your boundaries, you can be capable of living in harmony with them. True selfishness is being able to make other people do what you want just to achieve your own goals.</p><p>Have you had situations when you did something good but got something bad in return?
