Ginni Thomas, whose participation in the tea party movement of the early 2010s led to similar ethical questions for her husband, has said she was a participant in a Jan. 6 rally but did not participate in the Capitol riot.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A number of Democratic officials have used Ginni Thomas’ actions to pressure Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from pending cases involving the Capitol attack and the 2020 election, but he faces no obligation to do so.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">About one-fifth of voters (22%) said they had seen, read or heard “a lot” about the reports about Ginni Thomas, slightly more than the 18% who said the same about news that a federal judge said Trump “more likely than not” committed federal crimes in his attempts to block the count of Electoral College votes.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Seven in 10 voters (69%) agree with the judge that it’s a crime for elected officials to attempt to overturn the results of an American election, including 85% of Democrats and 53% of Republicans. A similar share of all voters (68%), Democrats (88%) and Republicans (51%) say the Justice Department should bring legal action against such officials.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But Trump gets more slack from the electorate when it comes to his latest request for foreign help in finding damaging information on President Joe Biden’s son.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Voters on Trump’s plea to Putin</strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">When it comes to Trump’s most recent entreaty, 46% of voters said it was inappropriate that he called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release information about Hunter Biden’s ties to a Russian oligarch.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Two in 5 voters, including 68% of Republicans, said Trump’s request of Putin was appropriate.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The latest </i><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>Morning Consult/Politico survey</i></a><i> was conducted April 1-4, 2022, among a representative sample of 2,003 registered U.S. voters, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOoKCnppliwam7zJqqZqyVrcG0ecKlmKudnpiybsDHqKSaq12nsqTB0pqj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
