People had many things to&nbsp;say about that, but she didn’t care. She focused on&nbsp;what she considered essential and suddenly found everything she was looking for.</p><p><h2>1. She was born in&nbsp;California in&nbsp;1958.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/476/dce/0dfeae521ebf3579b607817130.jpg><p>Michelle was one of&nbsp;the most sought-after actresses between the ’80s and the ’90s. She has an&nbsp;unmistakable beauty, perhaps due to&nbsp;her great ethnic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mix</a>. Although both she and her parents were born in&nbsp;the United States, her ancestors came from many different places, such as&nbsp;Germany, England, France, Ireland, Holland, Switzerland, and Italy, among others.</p><p>When she was younger, she studied stenography, but before finishing her degree, she decided she wanted to&nbsp;try acting. She became known for using her beauty to&nbsp;her advantage and participated in&nbsp;multiple beauty pageants, such as&nbsp;Miss California in&nbsp;1978. After that, she soon got an&nbsp;agent and started auditioning for movies and television.</p><p><h2>2. She reached the top in&nbsp;record time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3f/b2f/8094de5ee4bd96cb4f14c1bdfc.jpg><p>She became a&nbsp;successful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> very quickly. In&nbsp;just a&nbsp;decade, she went from landing small supporting roles to&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;movies and grossing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;million dollars. She was famous and had money, but her luck was not as&nbsp;good regarding matters of&nbsp;the heart. She experienced several failed relationships and even got married, but soon after, she divorced.</p><p>After a&nbsp;while, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thought</a> it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;her personal life. “My&nbsp;life and my&nbsp;career were intertwined. My&nbsp;career is&nbsp;still important to&nbsp;me, but after you achieve a&nbsp;certain amount of&nbsp;success, all that time you spent obsessing about your career turns against you, so&nbsp;the focus naturally has to&nbsp;come back to&nbsp;you.” After coming to&nbsp;this conclusion, she applied to&nbsp;start an&nbsp;adoption process as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother without defining in&nbsp;her application the preferred sex of&nbsp;the baby: she was open to&nbsp;whatever fate had in&nbsp;store for her.</p><p><h2>3. With the formalities already in&nbsp;place, she just had to&nbsp;wait.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff4/b51/60e80c56c79890786d03f4dd06.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;always knew&nbsp;I would adopt. I&nbsp;assumed&nbsp;I would give birth first and then adopt. But the time came to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, and&nbsp;I just reversed the order,” she later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. Everything was already in&nbsp;place, and as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were a&nbsp;pregnancy, all that remained was to&nbsp;wait for the big moment to&nbsp;arrive. One day, during that sweet wait, Michelle’s best friend <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>convinced</a> her to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;blind date.</p><p>At&nbsp;first, she refused because she had had several bad experiences. But after her friend insisted and under the promise that this would be&nbsp;the last blind date she would ever arrange for her, Michelle agreed. The plan was dinner and bowling with producer David E. Kelley. To&nbsp;the actress’s surprise, the date went very well; the rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p><h2>4. Fate brought her face to&nbsp;face with the man of&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/845/fd5/b807af50f3b27da3afa997ae18.jpg><p>Two months after meeting David, Michelle was approved for adoption. Her baby was a&nbsp;beautiful baby girl. She didn’t know how he&nbsp;would react, but she wasn’t about to&nbsp;back out of&nbsp;the adoption and her dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother. Surprisingly, he&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;support her and was committed to&nbsp;taking matters into his own hands and serving as&nbsp;the baby’s father.</p><p>“We&nbsp;had been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>together</a> for about two months. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;had this baby right away. Most people don’t have that. He&nbsp;totally rose to&nbsp;the occasion. We&nbsp;were both adults and were at&nbsp;the age where we&nbsp;were ready to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;family. So&nbsp;we&nbsp;were parents before we&nbsp;progressed in&nbsp;our relationship. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange way, that took the pressure off&nbsp;us as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. We&nbsp;had something else to&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on. It&nbsp;was kind of&nbsp;like perfect timing.”</p><p><h2>5. She understood that money and fame are not everything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e30/050/f30f0554ab89b7d2ede1b766d1.jpg><p>Later that year, the couple decided to&nbsp;get married, and almost thirty years later, they are still together, happy and closer than ever. David became a&nbsp;wonderful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stepfather</a> and loved little Claudia so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;legally adopted her, officially becoming her father.</p><p>We&nbsp;usually imagine celebrities always have employees to&nbsp;do&nbsp;the “dirty jobs” for them, but this was not the case for Michelle; she changed diapers, gave bottles, and woke up&nbsp;several times through the night, like any other mom. She wanted to&nbsp;enjoy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>motherhood</a> to&nbsp;the fullest, and while she never stopped working, she always stayed close to&nbsp;her daughter: “She comes with me&nbsp;to&nbsp;the sets. She loves people. People from other movies come to&nbsp;visit her. She has a&nbsp;contagious personality.”</p><p><h2>6. Her little family kept growing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cdc/36b/1199a6581185c3b80d954b2d22.jpg><p>Michelle’s family expanded with the arrival of&nbsp;the couple’s first biological child, John Henry, who has always gotten along great with his sister. Pfeiffer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stresses</a> that being a&nbsp;mother also made her a&nbsp;better person: “Having children, especially considering my&nbsp;career, forces you out of&nbsp;your narcissism. I&nbsp;mean, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;career, my&nbsp;product is&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;was nice that someone came along and took that focus away from&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;really needed a&nbsp;distraction from myself.”</p><p>Today, Michelle and David’s children are fully grown. The youngest, John, chose to&nbsp;keep his personal life away from the media and keep it&nbsp;completely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>private</a>. Claudia, on&nbsp;the other hand, has always been a&nbsp;great student, and after finishing a&nbsp;university degree in&nbsp;Slavic languages and literature, she is&nbsp;working towards a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doctorate</a>.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about the actress’s initial decision to&nbsp;adopt as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother? Do&nbsp;you know any couples who have adopted a&nbsp;child? We&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;hear their story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZurcuwmLKrXaC7psOMomSwp6WhsW6tw6inrWWdnrCpsculnGaolpq2p7LEq2SsoJGnsqV5x6iuZqCVp3qlrdSgn62doqh6orDOqauip55iv6KwyJyYpaSpYrCprc2gnJ1lmJq%2FbrjIn5xmcGFlf3R9jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
