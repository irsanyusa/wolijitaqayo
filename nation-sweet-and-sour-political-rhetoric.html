There will be no tax increase in 1973. However, there is one problem with that commitment. There will be no presidential tax increase. There could be a congressional tax increase.”—Nixon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">> “What really makes my heart bleed is that these bleeding hearts don’t have any sympathy for the people that stand in the South Vietnamese marketplace when rockets were deliberately aimed at them.”—Agnew.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">> “Things are so confused now we don’t know if we’re dealing with the old Nixon or the new Nixon or the old, old Nixon or the new, new Nixon or even with the old, old, old Nixon.”—Sargent Shriver.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">> “I guess we’ve got to just accept the fact that McGovern doesn’t have a plan for America.

That doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t be willing to die for something that represents the best that we want to protect in the world.”—Eleanor McGovern on whether she would be willing to die for the Thieu regime, as Julie Eisenhower and Pat Nixon had said they would.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">>”Nowhere in the Bible, not even in Revelation, is it written that black people have to vote Democratic.
