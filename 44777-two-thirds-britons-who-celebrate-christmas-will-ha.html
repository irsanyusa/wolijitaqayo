Six in ten (60%) say they will use an artificial tree they already own, while 7% plan to buy an artificial tree this year.</p><p>Britons aged 18 to 24 are most likely to be celebrating with a real Christmas tree, at 25% compared to 9% of the over-65s.</p><p>This is likely because the older generation has long since invested in an artificial tree, before environmental considerations became a factor, with two-thirds of those aged 65 and over using a fake tree they already own compared to 48% of 18-24 year olds.</p><h3>More than half of Britons believe an artificial tree is more environmentally friendly</h3><p>When considering manufacturing, materials, packaging and transport, a six-and-a-half-foot artificial tree has <a href=#>a carbon footprint equivalent to about 40kg of greenhouse gas emissions</a>. This is more than twice that of a real tree of the same size that ends up in landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree which is burnt.</p><p>More than half of Britons (54%) think that having an artificial tree is more environmentally friendly than having a real tree each year, with only 16% believing a real tree is the greener option. It is estimated that you would need to <a href=#>keep a fake Christmas tree for at least 7 years</a> before it has less of a carbon impact than buying a real tree each year.</p><h3>How do Britons with real Christmas trees dispose of them?</h3><p>In terms of disposing of a real Christmas tree following the festive season, a third of Britons (33%) will take advantage of their local authority’s special collection service, with the trees then shredded and used on gardens and parks. A quarter of Britons (25%) will take their tree to a recycling centre, while 16% will re-plant it, and one in nine (11%) will shred it and use it on their own garden.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZGyEeHnTsKZmrJiev6W%2FjJupoqyfo8Buw8eoZJydnJqvs63TnmScoKKewLW5wKxksKGcoXqprQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
