Shocking Secrets Unveiled!</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-11</div><p>Let’s test out to&nbsp;see <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;night owl or&nbsp;an&nbsp;early bird</u></a>. If&nbsp;you like to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;early in&nbsp;the morning and have more energy during the first part of&nbsp;the day, you’re certainly an&nbsp;early bird. On&nbsp;the flip side, if&nbsp;you come alive when the moon is&nbsp;high and the stars are out, you might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;night owl.</p><p>It&nbsp;also means you’re the type of&nbsp;person who can stay up&nbsp;into the wee hours, savoring the silence and tranquility that the nighttime offers. For you, staying up&nbsp;late is&nbsp;a&nbsp;breeze, while hitting the snooze button in&nbsp;the morning becomes a&nbsp;tempting routine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1a0/569/1d32705c41bc62713374c088de.png><p>But hey, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>there’s a&nbsp;little more to&nbsp;it&nbsp;than just early to&nbsp;rise or&nbsp;late to&nbsp;sleep</u></a>. The early birds, though they start off the day in&nbsp;high spirits, tend to&nbsp;wind down as&nbsp;the day progresses. Come afternoon or&nbsp;evening, they may find it&nbsp;a&nbsp;struggle to&nbsp;keep their eyes open. In&nbsp;contrast, the night owls might stumble out of&nbsp;bed in&nbsp;the morning feeling a&nbsp;bit... meh. It&nbsp;can take them anywhere from half an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;shake off the sleepiness and kick-start their engines. But once they’re past this initial slump, they gradually start to&nbsp;ramp up&nbsp;their energy levels.</p><p>Problem&nbsp;is, these so-called “morning people” seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;running the world. You remember the old saying, right? The one about the early bird catching the worm, or&nbsp;that going to&nbsp;bed and getting up&nbsp;early puts you on&nbsp;the fast track to&nbsp;becoming healthy, wealthy, and wise. We’ve heard them all, and there’s this general assumption that being an&nbsp;early riser puts you in&nbsp;the winning lane of&nbsp;life.</p><p>You don’t have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;research to&nbsp;see that modern <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>society is&nbsp;more comfortable for early risers</u></a>. You just have to&nbsp;look around you. Most shops start their schedules at&nbsp;nine a.m., for instance. School is&nbsp;also conveniently placed in&nbsp;the first part of&nbsp;the day. But guess what? Modern science is&nbsp;calling this out. We&nbsp;humans are all unique and that is&nbsp;reflected in&nbsp;our sleep-wake cycles, too, also known as&nbsp;chronotypes. And, according to&nbsp;some research done in&nbsp;recent years, we’re actually talking about six different chronotypes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4cd/7cb/1028925c4cba2c37c35a973dee.png><p>The study primarily targeted college students. They presented these individuals with six charts to&nbsp;understand their energy levels throughout the day (morning, afternoon, and evening). The participants then had to&nbsp;slot themselves into one of&nbsp;these categories. Surprisingly, only a&nbsp;mere thirteen percent are genuine morning enthusiasts. Almost double that number&nbsp;— twenty-four percent&nbsp;— are the people who burn the midnight oil. But the most interesting part is&nbsp;that the majority of&nbsp;people belong to&nbsp;entirely different sleep-wake cycles.</p><p>For instance, there’s a&nbsp;small yet spirited nine percent who are just bursting with energy all day long. On&nbsp;the other end of&nbsp;the spectrum, about sixteen percent of&nbsp;people are sleepy throughout their day. In&nbsp;scientific terms, these individuals are affectionately called “moderately active.” Then there are the eighteen percent morning-charged people who need a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;snooze in&nbsp;the afternoon.</p><p>Even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;add up&nbsp;the morning people, the all-day energetic folks, and the ones who need an&nbsp;afternoon siesta, we’ve got at&nbsp;most forty percent who function better in&nbsp;the morning. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;extrapolate this to&nbsp;the whole population, it&nbsp;seems like a&nbsp;minority of&nbsp;early birds are dictating our daily routines. I&nbsp;mean, think about&nbsp;it, not everyone is&nbsp;a&nbsp;morning person, but most jobs kick off at&nbsp;nine a.m., or&nbsp;even earlier in&nbsp;some cases.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/024/6fb/934cb15fc99ed371ea3d2084d1.png><p>Sure, there are some caveats to&nbsp;this study. For one, college students aren’t exactly representative of&nbsp;the entire population. Also, they are notorious for pulling all-nighters, either hitting the books or&nbsp;partying and then sleeping late into the morning. So, the study might be&nbsp;overstating the number of&nbsp;night owls and understating the early risers. And, let’s not forget, the students were asked to&nbsp;assess themselves, and we&nbsp;all know how precise that can get.</p><p>Even with these limitations, this research paints a&nbsp;pretty clear picture. It&nbsp;tackles the myth that we&nbsp;are divided into only two groups&nbsp;— the morning people and the night owls. In&nbsp;fact, a&nbsp;substantial chunk, if&nbsp;not the majority, are not morning people at&nbsp;all. With the growing trend of&nbsp;remote working, it’s a&nbsp;blessing for those of&nbsp;us who function better in&nbsp;the afternoons and evenings. Finally, we&nbsp;can sync our work schedules with our natural sleep-wake rhythms.</p><p>But let’s say the initial classification is&nbsp;correct, that there are only two types of&nbsp;people: those that like to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;early... and those that would rather not. It’s obvious that tending to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;later during the day might come with its own set of&nbsp;challenges. You might find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;concentrate during those first working hours. You might even underperform while in&nbsp;class if&nbsp;you’re still in&nbsp;school. It&nbsp;raises the question: Could night owls become early birds? Well, here’s what science has to&nbsp;say: it’s possible, but certainly not a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;cake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/048/984/78792f565e98fb628eac51c52a.png><p>Now, before we&nbsp;delve into how to&nbsp;make the switch, let’s get familiar with this fancy term named “chronotype.” Turns out that the chronotype saga isn’t a&nbsp;straightforward tale, though. It’s an&nbsp;intricate blend of&nbsp;nature and nurture, says science. On&nbsp;the nature front, many <a href=# title=genes data-link=tag>genes</a> are at&nbsp;play, helping determine whether you’re a&nbsp;nighttime binge-watcher or&nbsp;a&nbsp;sunrise chaser. A&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;studies have even highlighted hundreds of&nbsp;genes linked to&nbsp;morning people. These genes have a&nbsp;say in&nbsp;our circadian rhythm, which is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;fancy name for our natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to&nbsp;our chronotype.</p><p>That being said, your environment also plays a&nbsp;starring role. It’s like this: you engage in&nbsp;daily activities that sort of&nbsp;match your chronotype. Let’s say you’re a&nbsp;night owl. You’re all bright at&nbsp;night, so&nbsp;that’s when you choose to&nbsp;get your sweat on&nbsp;or&nbsp;hang out with pals. This, in&nbsp;turn, feeds your late-night tendencies.</p><p>The environment’s influence gives&nbsp;us hope, though! This means you can play around with your sleep-wake cycle to&nbsp;suit your lifestyle. Wanna become an&nbsp;early bird? Go&nbsp;slow and steady. Specialists advise gradually setting your alarm fifteen to&nbsp;twenty minutes earlier every few days over a&nbsp;period of&nbsp;weeks until you’ve hit your ideal wake-up time. Remember, consistency is&nbsp;your friend here. You might start adjusting as&nbsp;your work week progresses, but if&nbsp;you revert to&nbsp;your late-night ways and morning snoozes on&nbsp;weekends, you’ll hit a&nbsp;roadblock. That momentum you’ve been building all week will soon be&nbsp;gone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/842/601/85072153219562bc9edcc9a2ae.png><p>Light exposure also plays a&nbsp;crucial role. Before bed, switch off those screens to&nbsp;avoid blocking the production of&nbsp;melatonin, a&nbsp;hormone that sets your sleep-wake rhythm. When you wake&nbsp;up, let the light&nbsp;in, signaling your body to&nbsp;wrap up&nbsp;melatonin production. Late-night activity can mess up&nbsp;your transition, too. Swapping your night workout sessions for morning or&nbsp;afternoon ones could work wonders. You might even need to&nbsp;reconfigure your meal timings. But hey, if&nbsp;being a&nbsp;night owl suits you and doesn’t interfere with your commitments, feel free to&nbsp;keep that schedule.</p><p>You know how some people get super inspired by&nbsp;those top CEOs and try to&nbsp;replicate their ’crack of&nbsp;dawn’ routine, right? Well, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>it&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;as&nbsp;awesome as&nbsp;you think</u></a>! If&nbsp;you’re trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;early bird, but you’re cutting back on&nbsp;your beauty sleep, that’s a&nbsp;big no-no. You’re basically inviting a&nbsp;whole entourage of&nbsp;unpleasant stuff, like feeling grumpy, struggling to&nbsp;focus, potentially gaining weight, feeling jittery, and upping the risk of&nbsp;having heart problems.</p><p>And here’s another nugget of&nbsp;wisdom. If&nbsp;you’re hitting the ground running super early, you have to&nbsp;wrap up&nbsp;your work earlier too. Otherwise, what’s the point, right? Most sleep specialists have a&nbsp;bone to&nbsp;pick with big shots who start their day really early, but then also burn the midnight oil either in&nbsp;their offices or&nbsp;glued to&nbsp;their email inboxes. It&nbsp;sets a&nbsp;harmful trend. So, if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;night owl trying to&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;an&nbsp;earlier morning routine, maybe it&nbsp;isn’t all that good if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means compromising on&nbsp;healthy, restful sleep. You should be&nbsp;okay with making the necessary changes if&nbsp;you keep it&nbsp;balanced, though.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6zsYyypq5lkaN6pq3RpbBmmpmnsW670Walop%2BYqXqww8tmqqGnk6C2r7OMrJycqpWpwG7Bza%2BcoqSVmXp5fZRscG1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
