Perry showed her close relationship with the Australian model, who she even calls her “sister from another mister.”</p><p>Though she did break the “ex-wife, new wife narrative,” Perry’s choice of words left fans wondering if they could possibly have wed secretly. While Perry called herself the “new wife” longtime fans began to wonder if the couple wed privately. Now, fans are doing a deep dive into the topic.</p><p>So did <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry and Bloom</a> secretly tie the knot together? Well quite frankly, no they’re not currently married…yet. The couple has a lot to celebrate this month even if they haven’t had a chance to exchange vows yet. In reality, they have been engaged for four years as of this Valentine’s Day. During a helicopter trip in February 2019, Bloom did in fact pop the question to Perry, but things didn’t exactly go as planned.</p><p>“The champagne is, like, broken. The bottle is everywhere, and I’m still looking at the note,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Perry </a>said. “He’s pulling out this box that’s too big for his coat pocket. It rips his coat pocket, and his elbow goes into the champagne.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Katy Perry Explains Why They Haven’t Married Yet</h2><p>Speculations circulating that Perry is unsure about her plan to marry Bloom, the pop singer shot down the claims, stating she won’t say “I do,” until the couple can marry in a faraway and romantic location.</p><p>Last year, Perry explained that it was the Covid situation that ultimately led to their delayed wedding ceremony. Fortunately for them, things are starting to get better as far as the pandemic is currently dying down.</p><p>One of the most desirable couples in Hollywood is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Perry and Bloom</a>.
