Um, are you saying that it&nbsp;sounds too paradoxical to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true? Then, take a&nbsp;seat, I’ll tell you a&nbsp;story...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5be/49c/1b37e653bdb3514a8e688772fa.png><p>It&nbsp;was July&nbsp;26, 1959, when Rankin was piloting his F-8&nbsp;Crusader, a&nbsp;single-engine supersonic aircraft, along the North Carolina Coast. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;high-altitude flight, and Rankin, together with his wingman, Navy Lt. Herbert Nolan, were flying at&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;more than 47,000&nbsp;ft. Their jets, nicknamed “candy stripers” because of&nbsp;their unusual orange and silver-gray coloring, were moving through the air smoothly and lightning-fast.</p><p>The only thing that could cause some trouble was a&nbsp;<a href=# title=storm data-link=tag>storm</a> that was raging far beneath the planes, but now, it&nbsp;didn’t present any threat. However, the pilots were supposed to&nbsp;pass through this storm on&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;the Marine air base in&nbsp;Beaufort, South Carolina. Things took a&nbsp;turn for the worse when the aircraft was approximately 9&nbsp;miles and mere minutes away from the military base. Suddenly, Rankin’s engine quit, and the fire warning light switched&nbsp;on.</p><p>Unable to&nbsp;restart the engine that’d lost all power, the man knew he&nbsp;didn’t have many options. That’s why, desperately trying to&nbsp;keep his plane from gaining speed and going into a&nbsp;complete nosedive, Rankin radioed his partner, “Engine failure. I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;eject.” It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;terrifying decision since the altitude was too extreme, and the Marine didn’t have a&nbsp;pressure suit. The only thing that could help him survive was an&nbsp;oxygen mask with a&nbsp;limited oxygen supply.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e3c/578/d1f0ce588586733b14b16df6d2.png><p>In&nbsp;any case, the pilot didn’t have a&nbsp;choice. Without hesitation, he&nbsp;pulled the overhead handle that triggered the ejection, and in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time, he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the air, and his plane disappeared in&nbsp;the clouds below. Now, Rankin was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;free fall at&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;40,000&nbsp;feet, with a&nbsp;temperature of&nbsp;minus 65&nbsp;degrees F.&nbsp;Usually, sport skydivers make their jumps from a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;3,500 to&nbsp;10,000&nbsp;ft.</p><p>Only highly experienced experts jump from altitudes higher than 15,000&nbsp;ft. Even then, it&nbsp;can lead to&nbsp;serious complications if&nbsp;they don’t have all the necessary equipment, including a&nbsp;pressure suit (which, as&nbsp;you remember, Rankin didn’t have). That means that when the man found himself in&nbsp;the air at&nbsp;such an&nbsp;unprecedented height, he&nbsp;experienced severe decompression.</p><p>It&nbsp;felt as&nbsp;if&nbsp;his stomach had increased to&nbsp;twice its size, and his nose seemed like it&nbsp;was about to&nbsp;explode. His eyes, ears, and mouth started to&nbsp;bleed. For several blood-curdling moments, the Marine was sure that the decompression would finish him right away. Little did he&nbsp;know, he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;much more severe trial ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8f1/4a6/0cb9585ecf9a4455be9840b2cc.png><p>Rankin continued falling, and all he&nbsp;could feel besides all-encompassing fear was the shocking cold. His wrists and ankles were burning as&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone had put ice directly on&nbsp;his skin. He’d lost one of&nbsp;his gloves while leaving the plane, and his left hand felt completely numb. And to&nbsp;make matters even worse, he&nbsp;was still in&nbsp;free fall.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, the pilot had a&nbsp;parachute, but it&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;deploy automatically at&nbsp;an&nbsp;altitude of&nbsp;10,000&nbsp;ft. And even if&nbsp;Rankin had decided to&nbsp;open&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;simply wouldn’t have been able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. That’s why, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;seconds and at&nbsp;a&nbsp;dizzying speed, the man hit the very storm he’d been piloting his plane over just minutes before. And that’s when another calamity happened.</p><p>Rankin had been falling through the black clouds with almost no&nbsp;visibility for about five minutes, surrounded by&nbsp;lightning, rain, hail, and violent winds, when something went wrong with the barometer that was supposed to&nbsp;deploy his parachute automatically. Fooled by&nbsp;the violent weather raging around the Marine, it&nbsp;triggered prematurely, and the man got stuck in&nbsp;the very middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thunderstorm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/746/ffe/444eac5e268c5f00ff27187180.png><p>But it&nbsp;wasn’t just any old thunderstorm. Nope, the unlucky 39-year-old fighter pilot plunged straight into a&nbsp;cumulonimbus cloud. These clouds, which often look like huge puffy mushrooms, are incredibly dense and tend to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;areas where the atmosphere is&nbsp;extremely unstable.</p><p>Also, such clouds are vertical, and the peaks of&nbsp;the most monstrous ones can reach the height of&nbsp;70,000&nbsp;ft! The taller the cumulonimbus cloud&nbsp;is, the more unstable and violent it&nbsp;is&nbsp;inside. That was the circumstance Rankin ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;after his parachute opened too early. Conversely, even if&nbsp;his parachute had deployed at&nbsp;the supposed altitude of&nbsp;10,000&nbsp;ft, the man would still have been sucked back up&nbsp;into the cloud with the updraft.</p><p>In&nbsp;any case, the pilot didn’t have time to&nbsp;dwell on&nbsp;this. His body was tossed about as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was nothing more than a&nbsp;rag doll. He&nbsp;would hit the fabric of&nbsp;his parachute, fall back down, and repeat this cycle again. The tossing was so&nbsp;bad, that even the experienced fighter pilot felt seasick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d51/23b/02ab3a51289fe787e80935087e.png><p>Lightning snapped and crackled around Rankin, and even though he&nbsp;didn’t hear the thunder per&nbsp;se, he&nbsp;could feel it&nbsp;vibrating through his body. The hailstones were so&nbsp;big that at&nbsp;some moments, Rankin worried they would tear his parachute. But the worst happened when the pilot was falling through the rain&nbsp;— for several terrifying moments, the man was sure that he&nbsp;would drown. He&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;breath, but only breathed in&nbsp;mouthfuls of&nbsp;water.</p><p>If&nbsp;he’d stayed in&nbsp;that region of&nbsp;the storm for any longer, drowning while falling through the air would’ve become a&nbsp;frighteningly real outcome. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;hold his breath, but it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very dangerous thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;while falling at&nbsp;breakneck speed. Meanwhile, Rankin was also blown up&nbsp;and down, sometimes as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;5,000&nbsp;ft at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. It&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;him like he’d been falling for ages, with blasts of&nbsp;compressed air hitting him the whole time.</p><p>Fortunately, not only good things, but bad ones too, tend to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;end. When Rankin finally reached the bottom of&nbsp;the cumulonimbus tower, he’d been inside for more than 40&nbsp;agonizing minutes. The pilot was shocked to&nbsp;discover that he&nbsp;was relatively unscathed, the lightning hadn’t grazed him, his parachute was in&nbsp;one piece, and he&nbsp;hadn’t drowned in&nbsp;the rainwater. The only thing he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;worry about now was a&nbsp;safe landing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9dc/097/244abd5c9d8a9fdad5495775e7.png><p>At&nbsp;first, Rankin was going down toward a&nbsp;clearing, but his bad luck continued, because, at&nbsp;the last moment, a&nbsp;powerful gust of&nbsp;wind threw him into a&nbsp;tree. The parachute got tangled in&nbsp;the branches, and the pilot hit his head on&nbsp;the trunk. Luckily, he&nbsp;was still wearing his helmet and didn’t lose consciousness. After freeing himself and staggering to&nbsp;his feet, the pilot limped through the forest until he&nbsp;found a&nbsp;country road. But hitching a&nbsp;ride turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;tough task.</p><p>Imagine a&nbsp;man, standing on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road, covered in&nbsp;blood and dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;soaked, ripped up&nbsp;flight suit. No&nbsp;wonder there weren’t many volunteers to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;lift. But eventually, someone picked him up&nbsp;and drove to&nbsp;a&nbsp;payphone where Rankin managed to&nbsp;call for an&nbsp;ambulance. There, he&nbsp;found out what a&nbsp;lucky man he&nbsp;really was. He&nbsp;had countless bruises and welts scattered all over his body, he&nbsp;suffered from bad decompression effects, and he&nbsp;had frostbite. But other than that, the ordeal didn’t leave any long term damage.</p><p>Rankin spent several weeks in&nbsp;the hospital and made a&nbsp;complete recovery. Later, he&nbsp;wrote the book “The Man Who Rode the Thunder” where he&nbsp;described his experience. If&nbsp;you know other incredible survival stories, let me&nbsp;know down in&nbsp;the comments!
