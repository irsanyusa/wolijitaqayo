The talk show host also took the time to revisit her own journey in the competition. Placing seventh and second respectively, Hudson and Lambert didn’t have any regrets.</p><p>“Neither one of us won American Idol, and look at us now,” Hudson said. “We’re doing alright.”</p><p>For those who may not know, Lambert auditioned for the competition singing “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen. Amazingly, years later, he is performing as frontman of the band and has been touring with them for a decade.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hudson auditioned in the show performing “Share Your Love with Me” by Aretha Franklin. Coincidentally, Franklin herself <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chose Hudson</a> to portray her in her biopic, Respect.</p><p>“Fate, right?” Lambert said. “You have to plant the seeds.”</p><p>While talking about the experience, Lambert revealed that he’s more than just a one trick pony. On top of the genre he normally performs, he has opera experience. In high school, the singer apparently joined opera and deemed it as educational training. This probably explains his fascination over “Nessun Dorma” from Giacomo Puccini’s Turandot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They Sang to a Precise Classic Duet</h2><p>Subsequently, Lambert recalled performing “Nessun Dorma” with Queen on one of their tour stops in Italy. Apparently, he was singing the song during rehearsals when the British rock band unexpectedly proposed to perform the duet live in their concert.</p><p>“So, I just started singing it impromptu in rehearsal, and he [Brian May] just started playing and accompanying me,” he said. “It was this moment that happened, and we all said, ‘Let’s just do it tonight.'”</p><p>The EGOT holder didn’t let the opportunity slip and asked Lambert if they could <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sing the classic together</a>. The timing was even more perfect because Michael Orland, former American Idol arranger, was present to serve as pianist.</p><p>The duo began belting the technically demanding melody, propelling Lambert to comment, “This key is really high!”</p><p>Short after the performance, Hudson joked about having to sing the more comfortable parts of the song.</p><p>“He says, ‘Jennifer, this key is so high!’ I’m sorry, but this show is for me, baby,” she said.</p><p>The talk show host expressed her amusement over Lambert’s vocal range, describing it as “insane.” Indeed, this dramatic classic has proven the singer’s impressive singing skills.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American idol standout</a> is about to kick off The Witch Hunt tour. The eight-date concert will start on October 19 in Oakland, California and will have its finale on October 30 in Hollywood, California.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BillyRayCyrus_MileyCyrus.jpg alt="Billy Ray Cyrus Sparks Engagement Rumors Amid Rift with Miley Cyrus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wJ2YpmWclrqjsdGtZKOdnqO2p7HRZp%2BunKOku268xKudqKqdYry2wNKtmKecmaO0bq%2FLmqqsoZOWuW6w1J6raA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
