Yet, Gomez’s recent actions have brought her under scrutiny.</p><p>As a prominent figure with a significant fanbase, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gomez</a> utilized her massive Instagram following to share a succinct breakdown of the strike and show her apparent solidarity. She reposted a video of actor Domhnall Gleeson passionately discussing the strike’s essence. The intention seemed clear – to raise awareness and foster support for a movement she believed in.</p><p>However, Gomez’s subsequent post – a behind-the-scenes video from her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hulu</a> series Only Murders in the Building – quickly led to accusations of her violating SAG-AFTRA’s strike rules. These rules explicitly mandate that members should “refrain from posting on social media about any struck work.”</p><p>Critics argue that Gomez’s post, coupled with her actions, portrays an unsettling paradox. Her seemingly inconsistent approach, first siding with the strike and then violating its rules, raises concerns about the integrity of her activism and her understanding of the strike’s implications. Some have also criticized her for undermining the collective power of the strike and disrespecting fellow actors fighting for their rights.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-selena-gomez-deleted-her-only-murders-in-the-building-post>Selena Gomez Deleted Her Only Murders in the Building Post</h2><p>Following the backlash and accusations of breaking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA</a> strike rules, Gomez has taken down an Instagram post that showed her Hulu series Only Murders in the Building. The post, which seemed to be a video from the show’s set, garnered significant attention before being removed from Gomez’s profile.</p><p>The caption included a mention of the official Instagram account for the show and the words “Missing” and “wanting.” SAG-AFTRA’s strike guidelines prohibit members from promoting their work during the strike, whether through interviews or social media.</p><p>Only Murders in the Building, in which Gomez stars alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short, is currently airing its third season on Hulu. Despite the show’s ongoing success, Gomez and her costars have refrained from giving interviews about the latest season due to the strike. The series’ third season began on August 8 and will continue until October 3 on Hulu, with new episodes releasing every Tuesday.</p><p>While Gomez did not explicitly promote the show in the video, the mention of the show’s official account led many to assume the content was related to the Hulu series. The debate over whether this constitutes a rule breach has sparked discussions among her followers.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_AGTJudgesSeason18_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="‘America’s Got Talent Fantasy League’ Confirmed as Newest ‘AGT’ Spin-Off" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZqiVpL2tsYytn6Kmm2LAprjEp5hmn5%2Bisrt5zJqbnmWRYrCwutOrpq%2Bdoqi2oriMrKacoZGheq6xw6KYZqifqMFurcyim2arkZx6orLTq5hmq6Sntqyxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
