Unfortunately, my body is telling me that I’m just not ready yet and I am much too proud to have the first show that I do in nearly five years be half-assed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The band that will be replacing me on&nbsp;Power Trip&nbsp;will be announced shortly.&nbsp;They are personal friends of mine and I can promise that you will not be disappointed. Above all, I want to thank my fans, my band, and my crew for their unconditional loyalty and continual support. I love you all and I will see you soon. God Bless, Ozzy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Osbourne’s health has been an ongoing concern and he even announced his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>retirement from touring&nbsp;</a>earlier this year,&nbsp;although his statement says that he had planned to return to the stage in some capacity next summer. His retirement announcements are also to be taken with a grain of salt: He undertook his first “retirement tour” in 1992. However, in announcing this latest retirement from touring in January — due to a “a major accident, where I damaged my spine” — he left open the possibility of residencies or limited runs of dates, “where I will be able to perform without having to travel from city to city and country to country.” However, he apparently is not ready for such a move yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjqasrKGTZLumw9JoprOyqWK8tK7OrqmnnV2lwq240mamrqxdpby4sdFmq6uhoGKzpr%2FToq2apF1mf3SBlW9sbm5mZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
