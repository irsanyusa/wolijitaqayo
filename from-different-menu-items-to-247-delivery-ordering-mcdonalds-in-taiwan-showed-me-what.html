The cheese gave it a nice flavor, but the patty didn't necessarily taste any different than chicken. Still, it was my favorite of the Taiwanese McDonald's specialties I tried. Although I don't eat pork often, it's a flavor I recognize and being smothered in cheese made it melt in your mouth.</p><p>It cost 49 NT (New Taiwan dollars) which is about $1.60 USD.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>The shrimp burger tasted pretty much the same as the pork burger.</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-880bff1f-a55b-4bcf-8773-3c9787141144 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/IdmktktTURBXy8yNGNiNjk1NS05NzA5LTQ0MmMtODUzNC0xZGRjZWY2OTJjMGIucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>Martha Sorren</p><p>This sandwich also had a fried patty, which made it hard to determine the shrimp flavor amongst the breading. I'm not a huge seafood fan, so eating it cooked in a burger was a little out of my comfort zone. But even if the flavor had been more up my ally, the small a dab of Thousand Island dressing and sprig of lettuce didn't enhance the flavor much. It could have used more dressing, in my opinion.</p><p>It cost 69 NT or about $2.30 USD.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>The shake chicken had a DIY nature to it.</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d6571aa6-9886-40b0-9885-f52f32a257b9 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/rhTktktTURBXy9kMzkxODZiZi0zMDZhLTQyNDItODVlMS1mYTc0YjVjZjc3NTkucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>Martha Sorren</p><p>The shake chicken consists of a piece of fried chicken and some powdered wasabi.

I'd probably recommend sprinkling the package evenly over the chicken and then shaking it. That way you don't bite into one wasabi covered chunk that makes you cry. The chicken itself was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside like McDonald's is known for.</p><p>This was an add on item as part of a meal that also came with a drink and fries for an extra 33 NT, or about $1.10 USD.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-23>Corn soup was a drink option.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5406a213-0117-49b4-adb0-0e8f465eb46f data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/U77ktktTURBXy8wYWYwZDVmOC1jMjdmLTQ0NzktODQ0MC1iMTFmZDhkMjE1ZDMucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Martha Sorren</p><p>Instead of getting a soda or coffee with your meal, you could choose corn soup for about $1.10 USD. While the soup was good, and came with real corn chunks, it left me wanting a drink.

Honestly, American McDonald's should consider adding the hash brown side to the sandwich.
