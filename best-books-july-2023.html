That’s the question at the heart of Hila Blum’s How to Love Your Daughter, which is translated from Hebrew by Daniella Zamir. Centering on the bittersweet ruminations of Yoella, a mother who is estranged from her only child Leah—who left home at 18 and now has two daughters of her own—the novel considers the challenges, joys, and occasional heartbreak of motherhood.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: How to Love Your Daughter </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Nothing Special</i></b><b>, Nicole Flattery</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NothingSpecial.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Nicole Flattery’s debut novel, Nothing Special, a lonely but plucky teenage girl comes of age while working at Andy Warhol’s infamous studio, known as the Factory. The novel, which follows Flattery’s 2019 short story collection, Show Them a Good Time, follows Mae, a 17-year-old high school dropout with a tumultuous home life who becomes a typist for <a href=#>Warhol</a>. Mae’s work consists of answering Warhol’s infamous silver telephone and documenting the conversations and antics of the artist, his muses, and his star-studded crew, a routine based on the real-life recordings of day-to-day life at the Factory that uncredited typists transcribed at Warhol’s behest, which later became his 1968 book, a, A Novel. Immersed in the notorious scene of the Factory and the rampant cultural shifts of the Swinging Sixties, Mae begins to discover the person she wants to be.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: Nothing Special </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Immortal Longings</i></b><b>, Chloe Gong</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Immortal.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chloe Gong is best known as a YA author, but now she’s making her adult debut with Immortal Longings, a sultry and gripping fantasy epic novel about star-crossed lovers who must choose between power and love. Inspired by Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra, the novel is about Princess Calla, a reluctant royal with anarchist beliefs who will stop at nothing to bring down the crown and its corruption—even if that means murdering her own family. Calla’s final step to topple the monarchy comes down to a set of gladiatorial games<strong>.</strong> What she doesn’t bargain for is striking a deal with—and unexpectedly falling for—her opponent, a reality that will put all her plans in jeopardy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: Immortal Longings </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>The Vegan</i></b><b>, Andrew Lipstein</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TheVegan.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By all accounts, Herschel Caine, the protagonist of Andrew Lipstein’s The Vegan, has got it made: he’s a hedge fund manager who’s about to make it big, he has a beautiful wife, and he owns a townhouse in Brooklyn’s wealthy Cobble Hill neighborhood. But when a lapse in judgment leads to him playing a potentially fatal prank during a dinner party at his home, Caine begins to reevaluate his life as he knows it. Wracked with guilt and remorse, he’s inexplicably drawn to every animal he encounters—a neighborhood dog, a bird on the street, the two lizards he adopts from a pet store. Caine’s sudden affinity for animals also comes with a lifestyle change: he can no longer stomach the taste of meat and becomes a vegan. His seeming renouncement of vice has far-reaching consequences: he’s now bent on reforming the corruption in the stock trading that was going to make him obscenely rich. But, ever the finance bro, Caine now considers his path on the straight and narrow an asset—and he’s going all in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: The Vegan </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Silver Nitrate</i></b><b>, Silvia Moreno-Garcia</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SilverNitrate.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The magic of cinema meets the dark arts in Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s Silver Nitrate, a neo-noir thriller that dabbles as much in film lore as it does in the occult. For Montserrat and Tristán, two best friends on the fringes of Mexico City’s horror film scene in the 1990s, it seems like a big break is impossible—until they befriend Abel, a legendary yet reclusive director, who is convinced that his unfinished film is cursed. Although the trio sets out to break the curse and complete the film, their efforts soon spin into a surreal and supernatural chain of events that defy even their wildest dreams.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: Silver Nitrate </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>The Stolen Coast</i></b><b>, Dwyer Murphy</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TheStolenCoast.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In The Stolen Coast, Dwyer Murphy’s thriller of a crime novel, the sleepy, seedy Massachusetts beach town where protagonist Jack Betancourt lives is a destination for unsavory characters. Betancourt knows them well—he’s a fixer of sorts, in the same line of business as his former spy father, helping vagrants and thieves vanish when trouble strikes. But things get personal when his ex-flame Elena, a lawyer whose hands are less than clean, rolls back into town and back into Jack’s life after nearly a decade away. Elena has returned to take on a heist of epic proportions, but she needs Jack’s help to pull it off.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: The Stolen Coast </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Owner of a Lonely Heart</i></b><b>, Beth Nguyen</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OwnerOfaLonelyHeart.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her second memoir, Owner of a Lonely Heart, Beth Nguyen (who has also written under the name Bich Minh Nguyen) ponders the nuances of motherhood and the many forms it can take. Focusing on her relationship with her own mother, whom she was separated from as an infant after the author and her father fled Saigon for the U.S. during the Vietnam War, Nguyen considers the complexities of her connection to the woman who birthed her but became a stranger to her for nearly two decades. Nguyen also traces her own journey to motherhood and reflects on the many women who shaped her throughout her life. Fiercely compassionate, the memoir is a remarkable reflection on how we define mothers and daughters, Americans and so-called foreigners, and the true meaning of family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now</b>: <i>Owner of a Lonely Heart</i> on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>When Crack Was King, </i></b><b>Donovan X.

Ramsey seeks to reframe the narrative surrounding the crack cocaine epidemic of the ’80s and ’90s by telling its history through the voices of the community who survived its racist myths and devastating consequences. Drawing on intensive research and the stories of four individuals whose lives were indelibly shaped by the drug and its criminalization, Ramsey provides much-needed critique on not only drug policy past and present, but also the system that it upholds, urgently interrogating who it protects, who it punishes—and why.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: When Crack Was King </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Crook Manifesto</i></b><b>, Colson Whitehead</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CrookManifesto.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner <a href=#>Colson Whitehead</a> returns to Harlem with Crook Manifesto, a sequel to <a href=#>2021’s thrilling </a><a href=#>Harlem Shuffle</a>.

Organized in three parts, the book moves through vignettes that reference everything from Blaxploitation films to rampant fires that ravaged uptown Manhattan.

Drawing on extensive research, interviews with experts, and an original survey of 1,300 mothers, this deeply researched work traces the history of misogyny and racism in medical care when it comes to birthing bodies, from past to present. From male doctors overtaking midwives during the 19th century to the shortcomings of contemporary medical practices and procedures, Yarrow highlights the urgent need to reform the way we think about pregnancy and birth, making the case for better maternal health care as a human right.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now: Birth Control </b>on on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamllgHWCjpucrKxdl7ywt9Jmoa6kqWJ%2FcX6SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
