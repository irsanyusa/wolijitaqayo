We got vocals, costumes, drama, and everything we love from the show. The Cyclops may only have one eye, but he has quite the set of pipes!</strong></p><p>So who is the celebrity under the Cyclops mask? Let’s take a look at the clues and our prediction.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 7</h2><p>In Cyclops’s clues, we see a bedroom with someone sleeping in the bed, cuddling a pink teddy bear. Another teddy bear wearing a cowboy hat sits on a pink tricycle. The camera pans to Cyclops under the bed while he talks about “always being cast as the villain.” He groans about all the “cluttered corners” he has to hide in, then we see a compass pointed S-SE.</p><p>A picture of a turtle wearing a cowboy hat is displayed in the frame. He sells his product, “Cy-Drops” which come in a 4 oz bottle. It gives “fast relief for redness.” We see a comic book that says “BEWARE CYCLOPS” and “EVIL BEASTIE” and it says it has “86 BIG PAGES” and is from “22 JUNE 2017.” Cyclops says he’ll “always be a baddie.”</p><p>In the previews before the show, we also saw a treasure map as a clue for Cyclops, which had an “X” on it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-o7pEVdc9Y</p>The Masked Singer Cyclops performs “My Sacrifice” by Creed</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Cyclops</h2><p>Jenny McCarthy thought the Cyclops was WIlliam Sabka from Cobra Kai. Nicole Scherzinger guessed Danny McBride. And Robin Thicke predicted it could be Rob Dyrdek.</p><p>Though the panelists focused on actors, the most popular guesses online have centered around singers. The main names coming up are Darius Rucker, Uncle Kracker, Kid Rock, Jeff Hardy, and Jack Black. A decent number of fans have also agreed with Nicole, thinking it’s Danny McBride.</p><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;SEASON 7 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is the Cyclops on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Cyclops was definitely the hardest to nail down from the first group of contestants this season. Though a lot of the online guesses focused on singers, based on his voice we had to agree with the judges this is probably an actor.</p><p>And we now know the Cyclops is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eb4a6776-9b31-44f2-8abe-d267d1b20c62>Jorge Garcia<strong>!</strong></h2><p>The fan-favorite actor from Lost is a singer too?! Apparently yes. Let’s go through all the clues!</p><p>Before the season, the first clue we got was a treasure/pirate map with an “X” on it. This, as well as the compass we saw in his clues, are a nod to Lost, where Jorge Garcia plays Hurley. The treasure map could also be referring to the independent film When We Were Pirates. There are a lot of clues pointing to Lost and the supernatural nature of it, including a rocket, solar system, and the meteorite with “1988” accompanying it. One other clue pointing to his acting background was the whole bedroom scene, as he played a character on an episode of Tim and Eric’s Bedtime Stories.</p><p>Cyclops later mentions he “prefers monsters to heroes” and Jorge Garcia has a podcast talking about Japanese big monster films called Kaiju Poscast. The movie clues just kept coming, with the popcorn bucket and turtle in a cowboy hat. The cowboy hat points to his role in The Ridiculous 6. We also saw a comic book in his clues, which could be referencing the fact that he’s a comedian, or that he played a comic book store owner in the TV series Alcatraz.</p><p id=block-b059d09d-9b41-40c0-a5c4-c7c0ffec307f>Watch&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;on Wednesday nights for more clues and don’t forget to tune in to our&nbsp;<a href=#>Recap Show</a>&nbsp;for full episode breakdowns and new reveals each week!</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;FIREFLY</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>THINGAMABOB</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>RAM</a></strong></p><p>*Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article predicted Michael Rooker as the Cyclops.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/161058_1723-2.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Recap: Singer Makes Judges Cry with Moving Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZOusK27z6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
