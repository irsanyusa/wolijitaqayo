Spanish is the only official language of Costa Rica. It’s also the most widely spoken, though various indigenous languages are also still spoken throughout the country.&nbsp;</p><p>As in most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish-speaking countries</a>, the Costa Rican accent varies by region. From the unique pronunciation of the Spanish “r” to famous slang phrases like pura vida (literally “pure life”), Costa Rican Spanish is great for Spanish-language learners to study.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Do-they-speak-Spanish-in-Costa-Rica?>Do they speak Spanish in Costa Rica?</h2><p>Yes, Spanish is the official language of Costa Rica. Several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">indigenous languages</a> are also still spoken across Costa Rica, including:</p><ul><li>Bribri</li><li>Guaymí</li><li>Cabécar</li><li>Malecu</li><li>Buglere</li></ul><p>Though Spanish dominates, Costa Rica also has the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best English proficiency</a> of any Central American country (excluding Belize, where English is an official language).&nbsp;</p><p>For short-term visitors, English should be enough to get by. But for those staying longer, a deeper dive into Costa Rican Spanish can be richly rewarding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=‘Vos’-in-Costa-Rican-Spanish>‘Vos’ in Costa Rican Spanish</h2><p>One big difference you’ll hear in Costa Rican Spanish is the use of vos. It’s actually more common to use vos (you) and usted (you; formal) than tú (you). You may not hear tú used at all.</p><p>Vos as a form of “you” is not commonly taught to Spanish learners. But it’s definitely used in both Argentina and Costa Rica.</p><p>In Costa Rican Spanish, vos replaces tú and <strong>has its own conjugation:</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tbody><tr><td><strong>Verb</strong></td><td><strong>Vos conjugation</strong></td><td><strong>Tú conjugation</strong></td></tr><tr><td>vivir (to live)</td><td>vivís</td><td>vives</td></tr><tr><td>hablar (to speak)</td><td>hablás</td><td>hablas</td></tr><tr><td>ser (to be)</td><td>sos</td><td>eres</td></tr><tr><td>tener (to have)</td><td>tenés</td><td>tienes</td></tr><tr><td>traer (to bring)</td><td>traés</td><td>traes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-does-the-Costa-Rican-accent-sound-like?>What does the Costa Rican accent sound like?</h2><p>In general, Costa Rican Spanish sounds fairly relaxed and slow — unlike, for example, the rapid-fire <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish in Spain</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chile</a>. Depending on the region, though, you may notice some different features:</p><ul><li><strong>Central Valley: </strong>In the capital of San Jose and its surrounding areas, the accent is similar to that of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bogota, Colombia</a>. This may be due to the fact that, in the 19th century, the land of Costa Rica bordered the massive state of Gran Colombia.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pacific side:</strong> The accent has similarities to Nicaragua due to long political and cultural ties forged during the colonial period.</li><li><strong>Caribbean side:</strong> The Spanish in this part of the country is also influenced by forms of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Creole</a> English. This explains why there is no Spanish translation for the popular Costa Rica dish “rice and beans.” Up and down the Carribean coast, this dish is simply called riceandbeans —pronounced with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish accent</a>, of course.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Spanish ‘r’ in Costa Rican Spanish&nbsp;</h3><p>One unique form of pronunciation in Costa Rica is the r arrastrada (dragged r).&nbsp;</p><p>Many say this “r” is similar in sound to the “hard r” in US English. It’s pronounced more towards the back of the tongue and with no vibration.</p><p>The r arrastrada <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can be heard</a> in the following places:</p><ul><li>At the beginning of a word, e.g. Costa <strong>R</strong>ica</li><li>As a single or double consonant between vowels, e.g. a<strong>rr</strong>oz, a<strong>rr</strong>iba, pe<strong>rr</strong>o</li><li>At the end of a word with -rlo or –rla, e.g. tene<strong>r</strong>lo, compra<strong>r</strong>la</li></ul><p>Still, many words employ a more standard Spanish “r.” Examples include a<strong>r</strong>bol, t<strong>r</strong>abajo and palab<strong>r</strong>a.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Spanish ‘s’ and ‘d’ in Costa Rican Spanish</h3><p>As in other South American countries, the “s” in Costa Rican Spanish is often dropped. For example:</p><ul><li>“¿Cómo estás?” in Costa Rica will sound more like “¿Cómo ehtáh?”</li></ul><p>In some areas of Costa Rica, the final “d” may be dropped:</p><ul><li>calidad is pronounced calidá</li><li>usted is pronounced usté</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The final ‘n’ in Costa Rican Spanish</h3><p>One last difference you will hear when listening to Costa Rican Spanish is the pronunciation of the final “n.” If you listen closely, you may detect a native tico or tica pronounce /ng/ instead of just /n/:</p><ul><li>/bo-TONG/ for botón (button)</li><li>/hu-geh-TONG/ for jugetón (playful)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Costa-Rican-Spanish-slang-and-vocabulary>Costa Rican Spanish slang and vocabulary</h2><p>Of course, Costa Rican Spanish comes with its own lexicon of fun slang. Here are a few of our favorite slang words and turns of phrase:</p><ul><li><strong>Tico/tica</strong><strong> </strong>– a person from Costa Rica</li><li><strong>Mae</strong> – dude, man. ¿Qué mae? Todo bien, mae. (What’s up, dude? All good, dude.)</li><li><strong>Pura vida</strong><strong> </strong>– hello, thanks or what’s up?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Tuanis</strong> – all good. This comes from the English “too nice.” ¿Qué mae? Tuanis. (What’s up, dude? All good.)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Al Chile</strong> – for real: Al Chile? Al Chile, mae. (For real? For real, dude.)</li><li><strong>Vara</strong> – thing (object or situation) ¿Qué es esa vara? Ayer me pasó una vara. (What’s this thing? Yesterday, a thing happened to me.)</li><li><strong>A cachete</strong> – all good (literally means “to the cheek,” but it’s used to answer “How’s it going?”)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Costa Rican Spanish, “mae”</h2><p>Mirroring the country’s stunning biodiversity, Costa Rica is home to diverse ways of speaking. That means using vos instead of tú, pronouncing some consonants differently and dropping the word <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mae</a> about a hundred times per day.&nbsp;</p><p>If you visit Costa Rica, listen to how the different accents along the coast, in San Jose and in rural areas are different. Luckily for Spanish-language learners, Costa Ricans generally speak slowly and clearly enough for beginners to understand.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
