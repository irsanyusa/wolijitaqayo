The storm has led to evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, and left more than 150,000 electric customers without power.
The deaths—spanning San Bernardino County in the south to Mendocino County in the north—have been primarily caused by falling trees and driving on flooded roads, according to the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The storm has led to evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, and left more than 150,000 electric customers without power.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The deaths—spanning San Bernardino County in the south to Mendocino County in the north—have been primarily caused by falling trees and driving on flooded roads, according to the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A five-year-old boy in San Luis Obispo County remains missing after his mother’s car became stranded in the flooded coast and he was swept away on Monday. Only finding one of his shoes, rescuers had to halt their search for the boy because of how dangerous weather conditions were, according to officials.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Roads across central and northern California have turned into impassable rivers, leading to school closures and limited mobility exacerbated by fallen trees and mud and landslides along the state’s steep hillsides. The National Weather Service placed large swaths of the region under flood watch and noted that almost all of the state has seen <a href=# rel=noopener>400% to 600%</a> more rainfall than usual, over the past few weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/california-storm-flood-rain-07.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Our message to Californians is simple: be hyper-vigilant,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a <a href=# rel=noopener>press conference</a> Monday. “There are still several days of severe winter weather ahead and we need all Californians to be alert and heed the advice of emergency officials.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like many of his colleagues, Mike Doll, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather, has been following the flooding and examining the greater pattern of adverse weather this season in California. “Going back to the latter part of December is when this train of storms started and each one’s been varying in intensity,” Doll says. “It’s sort of a compounding factor, so each storm is bringing areas of heavy rain to many of the same areas that were hit by the previous storm, then the next one is going over similar areas, then the next storm and on and on…”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what to know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/california-storm-flood-rain-06.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Millions under flood watch</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As of Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service had a flood advisory in place for more than <a href=# rel=noopener>4 million people</a> across California and a small part of southern Oregon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In areas where wildfires have weakened or cleared out the hillsides, the land is prime for flash flooding and avalanches. “We’ve seen tons of reports of mudslides, rocks and boulders coming down on the roads,” Doll says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It can take weeks for authorities to fully clear and drain fallen debris and pools of water that block highways and streets. Californians should “be prepared to evacuate and definitely heed those notices,” Doll says. “If you’re driving and you come across a flooded roadway, do not drive through it, because you don’t know how deep the water is. You don’t know even if there’s a road under that water.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thunderstorms moving from north to south also carry heavy winds that knock out power and threaten tornadoes in southern counties. “With every storm, we have the risk of high winds bringing down trees and power lines,” Doll says, explaining the massive infrastructure damage that storms have already begun to cause. Houses along hills and coasts are especially prone to damage and have limited evacuation capabilities.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Record rainfall</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-10-at-5.29.17-PM.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The mountainous Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have already gotten more than 16 inches of heavy rain. In Santa Barbara, the town of Montecito—famously home to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex—is still recovering from wildfires and just passed the fifth anniversary of a mudslide that <a href=# rel=noopener>killed 23 people</a> in 2018.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Los Angeles County has recorded up to seven inches of rainfall and downtown San Francisco was under flash flood warning on Tuesday. Oakland and surrounding areas are being pelted with hail. Around Sacramento, forecasts predict an additional six to 12 inches of rain through Wednesday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What tends to happen is when you get runoff, creeks and rivers start to fill up and then you get more heavy rain,” Doll says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those living along rivers are particularly at risk. In central California, meteorologists are keeping a close eye on the Salinas River in Monterey County about an hour south of San Jose. “When it gets to 30 feet, which it’s going to be close to, there’s the risk of the entire city flooding,” Doll adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/california-storm-flood-rain-05.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Treacherous conditions could worsen</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meteorologists predict the relentless rain will continue for at least another week. Forecasts predict dryer weather in southern California from Wednesday through Friday, but continued rainfall in the north as a cyclone brews along the Pacific Coast.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Heavy rainfall will likely return over the weekend and could damage vulnerable infrastructure and impede ongoing rescue efforts. On Monday, President Biden issued an emergency declaration to dole out aid and relief efforts in more than a dozen affected counties.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like severe weather events around the world, the sudden change from scorching dryness to torrential downpours is catching Californians off-guard. Although not necessarily linked directly to climate change, such phenomena are becoming more common as the world warms and weather becomes more unpredictable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Doll points out one potential benefit of all the flooding. For California’s arid landscape, stockpiling ample water now across its reservoirs could be a big help for the warm months when droughts and wildfires plague the state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamRrgHGFjpyYpaGWpL%2BvtcBmnaWnn5m2r7OMrKuoqp2ofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
