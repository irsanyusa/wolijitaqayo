The popular group, hailing from India, is a danger act that stunned judges on season 14 of America’s Got Talent. They are looking to bring a new level of danger on the AGT All Stars stage, find out who they are as they perform extremely deadly acts.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bir-khalsa-group-leaves-the-audience-at-the-edge-of-their-seats-when-they-perform>Bir Khalsa Group Leaves the Audience at the Edge of Their Seats when they Perform</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bir Khalsa</a> is a daredevil group formed in Punjab, India, that stuns the crowd wherever they perform their fearless stunts. Although we’ve only seen only a handful of performers from the group, they are actually comprised of over 500 members.</p><p>The ever-present member of their group, is the towering Jagdeep Singh, the tallest policeman in the world with a height of seven feet six inches. Apart from Singh, the group has about 20 official members who are the top Sikh martial artists in the world.</p><p>The group competed and are the first runner-up in the second season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>India’s Got Talent</a> which was aired on Colors TV network. The group also owns four Guinness World Records, one of which is for smashing the most coconuts while wearing blindfolds.</p><p>Bir Khalsa is also recognized for instilling important lessons in the youth regarding drug abuse and other issues. Their acts are incredibly dangerous, and must not be imitated under any circumstances. Despite the obvious danger on doing their stunts, it has also propelled them to success after competing on AGT.</p><p>“Since we have come to America’s Got Talent we are getting calls from all over the world. We are getting called to Japan, Turkey, Italy, England to perform,” A representative for the group said. “This was the biggest platform for us. Our life has changed after coming here.”</p><p>The group most recently entered the tenth season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia’s Got Talent</a> on Channel Seven, and they made it to the semifinals. Their next goal is to bring the excitement with more dangerous and never before seen deadly acts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>They Had a Feud With Their Former Manager</h2><p>Their success didn’t come without any problems however, and their biggest challenge came from their own manager Karamjeet Singh. He almost cost the entire Bir Khalsa group their shot at auditioning on AGT.</p><p>“We had a manager called Karamjeet Singh. He cheated us so badly. He was with us for four to five years. When we went to Germany, he took money from there in our names by making fake bills,” A member said. “We thought we might have to leave this show because of him. When we had fired him and were not getting anyone else, we were very tensed.”</p><p>The former manager of the group allegedly cheated the group’s finances by making fake bills and keeping their earnings to himself. Luckily enough, they’ve since found a new manager that’s supportive of their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All Stars</a> run.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ArianaGrandeTattoo-220x147.jpg alt="What Happened to Ariana Grande’s Butterfly Tattoo?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZpmcoXq0wMCrqmabn6PBpr%2FTmqWtZZKev263x5qjrJldnL%2Bwwc9mq5qjlah6pa3NoJyrp6WoeqKv02arqGWknbJusdetqZ6llWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
