Stripping away the non-voters and the undecideds reveals those familiar figures: 52% would vote to leave, and 48% to remain.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Eurovision20201920toplines-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Unsurprisingly, it’s those who opted for Brexit back in 2016 who are most likely to want to quit Eurovision: 34% of all Leave voters (or 71% of Leave voters who cast a vote on Eurovision), compared to only 18% of all Remain voters (36% of those who cast a Eurovision vote).</p><p>The survey also reveals that Britons are substantially more likely than people in six other European countries to believe that Eurovision is an inherently political contest. Close to a third (31%) of Brits who’ve watched the show believe the voting is based solely on politics, with a further 35% thinking it’s a factor. By contrast, only between 4% and 15% in the other European nations who have seen the show think that politics is the sole motivator when scoring, with a further 26% to 48% believing it plays a part.</p><p>Those who voted to Leave the EU in 2016 are more likely to think that the voting is entirely political (40%) than their Remain counterparts (26%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Eurovision20political20motivations-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Britons are less likely to be watching Eurovision, and our motivations for doing so tend to be different from other countries</strong></h4><p>Overall 82% of Brits have ever watched the Eurovision Song Contest, and a quarter of us (23%) intend to tune in for this year’s edition.</p><p>The anticipated viewing figure is markedly higher in Denmark (34%), Germany (36%), Norway (48%), Sweden and Finland (both 49%). Only the French are as unlikely as us to be watching (26%).</p><p>Britons most noticeably differ from other Europeans in that they seem to enjoy the competition on an ironic level.</p><p>A quarter (25%) say that the amusing commentary is the reason for watching, compared to just 4% to 10% in other countries. This was the most popular reason among Britons, and is doubtless down to the sarcastic stewardship of Terry Wogan and Graham Norton over the years.</p><p>We also tend to be more likely to say we watch it so we can make fun of it (19%, compared to between 7% and 11% everywhere else except Norway, where they are even more likely than us to be mocking the acts at 24%).</p><p>Other countries tend to have ‘nicer’ reasons for watching: the most popular response in Finland (44%) and Germany (25%) was to see how people from other countries perform; in France it’s because they like the music (19%) and in Denmark and Sweden it’s because their friends and family are watching (21% and 25% respectively).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Eurovision20reasons20for20watching-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>See the Eurotrack toplines <a href=#>here</a> and the detailed UK data <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmiAeYKMm6mirKNixKK602ajnpmmmnqmwdGoraKrmaS7boGRZmtx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
