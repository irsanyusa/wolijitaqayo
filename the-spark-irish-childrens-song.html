“The Spark,” a song by a group of Irish tweens that has taken off online since its release in May might just be the catchiest—and most inspiring—tune of the summer. 
“Think you can stop what we do? I doubt it. We got the energy, I’ll tell you all about it,” goes the chorus. “I searched for my spark and I found it, everybody in the club start bouncing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We found the beat and started coming up with chant and chorus ideas,” Kabin Studios creative director Garry McCarthy told The Guardian. He said the kids worked together to come up with the chorus and the verses. “The response has been amazing. The kids’ energy and positivity has inspired people. It’s a really catchy song.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After it was reposted by a popular TikTok account in a <a href=#>video that accumulated</a> over seven million views, “The Spark” began catching on. When Kabin Crew appeared <a href=#>on an Irish radio show</a>, that video got over six million views. The videos posted on the <a href=#>Kabin Crew’s TikTok</a> of the song have accumulated over four million views.</p><a title=@thekabinstudio href=#>@thekabinstudio</a><p>We can't get over the amazing reaction from people. ❤️ Young rappers from The Kabin Studio in Cork & Lisdoonvarna have teamed up to make a belter for Cruinniú na nÓg, the national day of celebrating youth creativity 🔥 Songwriting, rap & recording workshops by Garry McCarthy @Garry / GMCBeats & @thekabinstudio as part of the @Rhyme Island initiative Beat by @PapaPedro Beats Video shot & edited by Seán Downey @Swan Huge thank you to Caoimhe, Jackie, Rosaleen, Alex, Aaron, Mark, Katie, Róisín, Sophie, Stacey and Claire, the wider Kabin/Lisdoonvarna team, The Kabin Youth Council and the families for all their help and assistance in bringing the song & video to life 🔥</p><a title="♬ original sound - The Kabin Studio Cork" href=#>♬ original sound - The Kabin Studio Cork</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Their energy and enthusiasm is infectious, and it’s hard not to bounce along and recite the lyrics along with the kids.
