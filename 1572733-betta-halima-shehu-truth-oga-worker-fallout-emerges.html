suspended Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Betta Edu, was accused of instructing the Accountant-General of the Federation, Oluwatoyin Madein, to <a href=#>transfer</a> N585 million to a private account.</p><p class=align-left>This news stirred public outrage, and <a href=#>Edu's media team dismissed the leaked memo </a>as a blackmail tactic, asserting that the minister's request adhered to proper procedures and was prompted by the exposure of fraud in NSIPA.</p><p class=align-left>In response to the controversy, President Bola Tinubu suspended Edu and directed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to<a href=#> investigate the ministry's finances.</a></p><h2>How the rift started</h2><p class=align-left>As reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Cable,</a> before President Bola Tinubu nominated Halima Shehu as the CEO of NSIPA, Delu Yakubu, who currently serves as the senior special assistant to the president on humanitarian affairs and poverty alleviation, was initially selected for the role.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d4ac90f9da6d8f65.jpeg></a><a

class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Betta Edu: EFCC releases suspended minister on bail after hours of grilling</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, certain senators and officials within the presidency expressed reservations about Yakubu's suitability for the position.</p><p class=align-left>Consequently, Yakubu was not appointed as CEO but instead given a role as a presidential aide.</p><p class=align-left>Subsequently, President Tinubu successfully confirmed Halima Shehu as the CEO of NSIPA in October.</p><p class=align-left>According to an insider, the decision to work with Yakubu was influenced by a higher level of comfort that Edu, presumably another official, had with Yakubu.</p><p class=align-left>The source, as quoted by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Cable</a>, said:</p>“The minister expected to work with Yakubu because she was comfortable with her but when Shehu found her way to the position somehow, Edu was not happy.“This did not create a harmonious working environment between both women from the outset.”<p class=align-left>The source also revealed that their feud was also related to the money issue, noting that the minister was a signatory to the NSIPA account but breached protocol by not letting the NSIPA boss know about her withdrawals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img

said:</p>“Shehu got angry over that and the only way she thought she could still retain control over her agency was to transfer the remaining balance out of the accounts that Edu had access to.“She has disclosed to the EFCC the three accounts where she moved the money to.”<p class=align-left>According to another source, specific individuals within the accountant-general of the Federation (AGF) office were designated as signatories for these accounts.</p><p class=align-left>This measure guaranteed that the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs could access funds whenever necessary.</p><h2>No official memo on acting NSIPA boss</h2><p class=align-left>Sources in the agency revealed that there has yet to be an official communication from the presidency regarding the appointment of the acting CEO for the agency, causing heightened confusion within NSIPA.</p><p class=align-left>The source said:</p>“Like in the case of Betta Edu, we saw the presidential spokesman issue a statement and it was clear on who she should hand over to — that has not happened in this case.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img

more officials superior to Egbuwalo who can act now that Shehu is no longer there.”<h2>Tinubu sacks 2 Buhari appointees</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, President Tinubu has sacked two directors appointed by former President Muhammadu Buhari.</p><p class=align-left>Babatunde Irukera, the chief executive officer of the <a href=#>FCCPC,</a> who was appointed by <a href=#>Buhari</a> in 2019, was the first casualty.</p><p class=align-left>Alexander Ayoola Okoh, the director-general and CEO of BPE, who was appointed by Buhari in 2017, was the second to be sent out of office by Tinubu in his latest agencies' reshuffling.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid
