Bridezilla has recently walked the aisle in their prettiest outfit, but they’ve moved out of the way for Avocado.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-avocado-joins-the-masked-singer-season-8-line-up>Avocado Joins The Masked Singer Season 8 Line Up</h2><p>On August 29, E News exclusively revealed the brand new Avocado costume on The Masked Singer season 8. The mystery celebrity behind the mask must love guacamole, avocado toast, or green smoothies!</p><p>The new costume features a glittery green ripe fruit, with a smiling face in the pit. The celebrity’s arms and legs will be covered by green clothing in the costume, since they stick straight out of the middle of the Avocado. The outfit is very reminiscent of <a href=#>team cuddly</a> from The Masked Singer season seven.</p><p>The official social media account for The Masked Singer has yet to announce the addition of Avocado to the line up. Instead, they revealed an Instagram exclusive first clue for <a href=#>Bride</a> on August 30.</p><p>Even though it’s too early to comment on which celebrity this could be, fans have begun forming their first guesses. Fans quickly noticed that the costume seems small, so they think it may be a teen star of some type. Although guesses have been made that this is <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>, many have disagreed saying he wouldn’t fit in the costume. Other fans commented on the costume design, stating that it’s “nightmare fuel” and looks like “the Kool-Aid Man.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Else Do We Know About Avocado?</h2><p>There’s still a lot unknown about this costume at this time. Along with the reveal of Bride, it was announced that the costume was created by Tim Chappel, know for working on designs for The Masked Singer Australia. Fans loved the costumes on this season of <a href=#>The Masked Singer Australia</a>, so many are hoping he’s the main designer for this season of the USA show.</p><p>Avocado is a the second costume revealed alongside Bride for the upcoming season of The Masked Singer. This show returns to FOX on Wednesday September 21 at 8 p.m. ET. Beloved panelists, Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Robin Thicke, and Ken Jeong are set to return to their places for the season. Nick Cannon will also return to the series as the host. The network recently revealed that this season will feature performances by both Thicke and Scherzinger.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_KelseaBallarini_EXHusband_Taylor-HillGetty-Images.jpg alt="Kelsea Ballerini Is Getting a Divorce After Almost Five Years of Marriage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6trrVnqClq12jsrh5wqiqra2dmnqiws6cmJ2nXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
