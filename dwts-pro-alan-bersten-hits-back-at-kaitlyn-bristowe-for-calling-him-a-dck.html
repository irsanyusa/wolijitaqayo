As per the professional choreographer, he prioritizes the comfort of his dancing partner all the time.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alan-bersten-responds-to-kaitlyn-bristowe-after-she-claimed-he-s-kind-of-a-d-ck>Alan Bersten Responds to Kaitlyn Bristowe After She Claimed He’s “Kind of a D*ck”</h2><p>In an earlier episode of Kaitlyn Bristowe’s podcast, Off The Vine, the Bachelorette star opened up about DWTS. If you missed it, within the podcast, the Season 29 winner gave advice to fellow Bachelorette alum Charity Lawson. While speculating that Alan Bersten may be Lawson’s partner on this season, Bristowe didn’t hold back and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">warned Lawson</a> about the pro.</p><p>“He’s kind of a d*ck, but I can see it. Well, they’re all d*cks. They’re all d*cks, I’m telling you. Buckle up,” she said.</p><p>Her comments eventually reached Bersten, who took the time to respond. In his interview with Us Weekly last week, Bersten refuted the celebrity’s claims.</p><p>“First of all, I never danced with Kaitlyn, so I don’t know why that would even come up,” he told US Weekly on Wednesday. “I take a lot of pride in my work and I make sure that above all else, my partners feel comfortable and confident in themselves.”</p><p>Nonetheless, the ballroom dancer gave space for the benefit of the doubt. According to him, he “kind of” took Bristowe’s words as a compliment.</p><p>On Saturday, however, the Bachelorette star came clean regarding her previous statements on Saturday. In a since-deleted Instagram Story, the DWTS alum stated that even she can be a d*ck sometimes.</p><p>“Alan is one of my closest friends from the show,” she wrote. “I have nothing but love and respect for him. I think it’s OK to be a d*ck and push people to believe in themselves and light a fire.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-apologize-to-him-amid-his-partnership-with-jamie-lynn-spears>Fans Apologize to Him Amid His Partnership with Jamie Lynn Spears</h2><p>For DWTS season 32, Bersten is paired with Zoey 101 alum Jamie Lynn Spears. With their rehearsals underway, the pro stated that he and Spears are getting along so well.</p><p>However, since the announcement of the show’s official celebrity cast, Bersten’s fans have been vocal about their possible lack of support in terms of voting. Apparently, many DWTS fans believe that Spears should’ve not been allowed to join the show because of her alleged rift with her pop megastar sister <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britney Spears</a>.</p><p>“Alan when you get voted off right away… it wasn’t you…,” one user wrote. “This is so unfortunate. I’m so sorry Alan.”</p><p>“Alan, there is always next season,” another person commented.</p><p>As per his celebrity partner, Bersten has been a “wonderful” dancing match so far. Spears stated that her family was already able to meet him and the interaction has been great.</p><p>Season 32 of Dancing with the Stars premieres Tuesday, Sept. 26 on ABC, and will stream on Disney+ and ABC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_DWTSNight1Lineup-220x147.jpg alt="Which Dances Will We See on the ‘Dancing with the Stars’ Season Premiere?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xurcuapWaalafAtbHNZp%2BirKNir6KvymaYrWWblra1uNinZJuqmajBsMPEZp2oql2Yrq24yKeeZqCZonqiecOcomg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
