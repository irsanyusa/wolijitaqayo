Deadpool & Wolverine is the only Marvel movie released this year, making it the most anticipatedâ€”for a good reason. The fast-talking anti-hero Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) is finally making his way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe through a sort-of buddy comedy team-up film with Wolverine (with Hugh Jackman reprising his role from Foxâ€™s X-Men movies). However, it is hard to say that Wolverine would call each other buddies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The fast-talking anti-hero Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) is finally making his way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe through a <a href=#>sort-of buddy comedy team-up</a> film with Wolverine (with Hugh Jackman reprising his role from Foxâ€™s X-Men movies). However, it is hard to say that Wolverine would call each other buddies. This movie is filled with cameos from forgotten X-Men and Marvel characters that were the most at risk of getting lost in the <a href=#>Disney/Fox acquisition shuffle</a>, such as Blade (revived by the original actor Wesley Snipes), Elektra (reprised by Jennifer Garner), and Gambit (played by Channing Tatumâ€”who has been trying to make a film centered around the character for a while).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In addition to the star power in the cameos, thereâ€™s one character that got a lot of buzz and sparked conversation online as first-look stills began to flood the internet: Lady Deadpool.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the comics, Lady Deadpool is a female version of Deadpool from an alternate universe named Wanda Wilson (the male Deadpool is Wade Wilson). In the filmâ€™s publicity leading up to its release, Marvel didnâ€™t reveal who was playing the masked character, preferring to leave it as a mystery to tease fans. And even in the movie, Lady Deadpool doesnâ€™t take her mask off; it's only revealed who she is in the end credits scene.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rumors began swirling about who was behind the mask, with some suggesting that Taylor Swift was making a cameo in the movie, while others theorized that Reynolds himself was playing the character. But it's Blake Lively, Reynolds' wife, making her MCU debut as Lady Deadpool.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know itâ€™s probably Blake Lively but itâ€™d be SO funny if Lady Deadpool is just Ryan Reynolds in a wig. <a href=#>https://t.co/pjMxid0Osq</a></p>â€” The Green Kasey ðŸŽƒ (@RawbertBeef) <a href=#>July 16, 2024</a><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Lady Deadpool's movie moment</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the movie, Deadpool and Wolverine try to stop the villain, Cassandra Nova (Emma Corin), from using a device called a Time Ripper to heighten her powers that seemingly already have no limits. Cassandra has enslaved almost all of the living beings in The Void â€”a receptacle for forgotten and abandoned heroes and villainsâ€”and she seems to have collected a few Deadpool variants along the way, including Cowboy Deadpool, Kid Deadpool, and, bizarrely, floating skeleton head Deadpool.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the original Deadpool (who refers to himself as Deadpool primeâ€”or better yet, Marvel Jesus) and Wolverine try to reach Cassandra, the Deadpool variant army is her first line of defense. Lady Deadpool leads the pack.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cameos and plot points for the MCU are notorious for being kept under wraps. However, on Tuesday, IMDb had already listed all of the cameos and guest stars that appear in the movie with Livelyâ€™s name appearing next to Lady Deadpool as well as Snipes, Garner, Tatum, Henry Cavill, and Chris Evans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBogHOAjp2cmpygpLytecCnm2avn6HDpr7Ip5xmpJGZxm6wxJqbqaefoXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
