When meeting a man how can you recognize qualities of a good husband and father him. What character traits and behavioral features should you pay attention to first of all?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/894fced06e4ad375.jpg><p class=align-left>What will tell you that this is a decent and reliable man who will love you and take care of your children? And what should a good father and husband be like at all?</p><h2>The ideal husband is a rare bird</h2><p class=align-left>Let's start with the fact that there are no perfect men. As well as, by the way, ideal wives. Therefore, you should immediately be prepared for the fact that certain personal qualities of your companion will not correspond to your ideas about what your prince should be.</p><p class=align-left>Another question is how to recognize what is critical for you, but what can you put up with?</p><p class=align-left>Undoubtedly, there are a number of criteria that will indicate to you that in the joint family life you will be fine with this person. Let's look at them in more detail.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1296b4fff1d4c0a9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best tips on how to be a good boyfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He knows how to show you his love, and regularly win you over and over.</p><p class=align-left>Absolutely any woman should feel needed and loved. If your man knows how to cause these feelings in you - this is a pledge that you will feel well next to him.</p><p class=align-left>The methods here can be diverse, it is not only about gifts and original dates. It is more about respect and support. Daily assistance, attention to your physical and mental state, readiness to take on part of your problems and tasks.</p><p class=align-left>Of course, romance has not been canceled. If your companion has any difficulty - help him, and not sawing because of not presented flowers. Express your joy and gratitude for what he does for you, gently tell him what else you would like.</p><h2>His relationship in his own family</h2><p class=align-left>Carefully look at his relationship with his family and friends where he was born and raised. On whether he helps parents. How close and stable is his relationship with them? How he communicates with his sisters and brothers, whether he takes part in the education of his nephews and nieces if there are any.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b737661fe0be63e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>70+ interesting questions to ask your boyfriend when bored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If your partner appreciates his family and relationships with their loved ones, this is a sure sign that he is internally ready to start a family and have children in it.</p><h2>The stability of his material and emotional state</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1296b4fff1d4c0a9.jpg><p class=align-left>We are not talking about the fact that your man will provide you with a paradise tale and a comfortable and carefree life. Is he ready to work for his family, and not only financially? How does he approach to solving complex issues and problems? Does he manage to cope with stress?</p><p class=align-left>If a man understands the full extent of male responsibility in the family and is ready to take it on himself - this is the future worthy and reliable husband.</p><p class=align-left>Such a man makes maximum efforts to everything that he does, whether it is his work or the solution of some everyday everyday issues. And he is ready to be the support of his family, the main person who will ensure her well-being and protection.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c231d9d830fee206.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 10 ways to make your husband love you more</span></p></a><h2>You have the same values and outlook on life</h2><p class=align-left>The romance of the phrase “Opposites attract” rarely works in family life. Because you have to look in one direction, be like-minded, strive for one result, at least in a relationship. And respect and support relate to the choice of a partner.</p><h2>He treats you without judgment and does not accuse you</h2><p class=align-left>If you often hear words of disapproval, reproaches, and condemnation in your address, this is a serious reason to think whether you are suited to each other. Of course, the partner can and should express his attitude to what and how you are behaving, but not in this form.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Importance of family and friends<strong></strong></p><p class=align-left>If there is no support and offers of help in discussing your actions and decisions, this is not the person with whom you can decide something together.</p><h2>You trust his opinion and you go for advice on any issue to him</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ffe0cbd75bf36b7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to know if he still loves you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Your man is first and foremost your friend, to whom you seek advice and help on any matter. You are not afraid not to be accepted and are not ashamed of your difficulties in front of him, and it is his support and help that you appreciate more than any other.</p><h2>The ability to make joint decisions</h2><p class=align-left>Not only you trust your future husband, but he also appreciates and values your opinion. And all the decisions are taken together, and together you are responsible for them. He knows how to be a good husband and you know how to be a good wife.</p><h2>His willingness to solve your problems</h2><p class=align-left>Naturally, it is not necessary to charge the man of all the possibility of tasks and problems. But the most important quality of the head of the family is his ability not only to support you morally but also to help with the solution of your difficulties practically. You do not have to solve all your questions yourself, let him take the maximum part in your life. It's veru important when a man becomes a father, so he can take care of your kids on his own if it's needed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2dcdeebf4c348981.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How do men show that they love a woman deeply?</span></p></a><h2>He is sincerely proud of you and emphasizes your services to your loved ones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4f94c543a1ab972b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Do you feel that your man is proud of your achievements and successes? He lets you know that he is happy that there is such an amazing woman next to him. Perhaps he even publicly expresses his admiration for you in a friendly or family circle. This is a sign of his sincere attitude towards you, that your relationship and your love are valuable to him, and he recognizes this in front of others.</p><h2>He is ready to maintain simple household rules</h2><p class=align-left>They are not worth any effort, and if a man is ready to accept them, this is very great! Because in everyday life all the irritation is made up of small things.</p><p class=align-left>Remember the main thing - your behavior means a lot to a man, but if there is no harmony at the level of household rules, the relationship will be very tense.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4f94c543a1ab972b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top characteristics of true love</span></p></a><h2>He helps you with the housework</h2><p class=align-left>In different families, life is arranged in different ways. If both of you are working, then the loving husband will share his household affairs with you, or at least some of them. Common efforts will make homework easier and possibly even more enjoyable. Cooking dinner together will add romance to an established lifestyle, provide an opportunity to be together, create an atmosphere of comfort and community.</p><h2>He understands your female hormonal surges</h2><p class=align-left>A good husband knows that every month even the most loving woman turns into a not very pleasant, but irritable creature with a bold temper. Just because that is her feminine nature. The ability to treat this correctly is an extremely important quality for a man with whom you are going to live for many long years.</p><h2>The similar sense of humor</h2><p class=align-left>You have something to laugh about together. Extremely important quality, because life is not easy and full of trouble. Relaxing together, laughing at the situation and yourself in it, and being understood, the ability to defuse the atmosphere, to relieve tension from one another - this is what a similar sense of humor will help. This is a sign of the similarity of your intellects and the shortest path to intimacy and mutually relaxed atmosphere in your communication. A sure sign that you are well together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e29959e0db464607.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 qualities of a good friend</span></p></a><h2>He is trying to be better for you</h2><p class=align-left>You feel that your man is trying for you. It does not matter whether it is expressed in his career, spiritual or intellectual development, in the fight against bad habits or negative qualities of character. If your man makes efforts to become worthy of you - it is a good sign.</p><h2>He loves children</h2><p class=align-left>If a man treats kids well, he can spend some time with his friends' children - you should pay attention to it. If a man says he wants to become a father, it means he means it.</p><p class=align-left>If you want to be with your beloved man - you need to figure out whether you are compatible according to these features. However, the qualities for a good husband and dad may be different for every lady.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Baby shower ideas for girl and boy</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN8k3FtbWWhqq6ttdOinKxlkWK0sLvDZp%2Buq5KWu6V5xZqroZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
