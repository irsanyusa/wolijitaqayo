It is so common to hear people say, and you surely must have heard it too, that women should not be giving husband privileges to boyfriends.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-17bb6083-2e49-49e0-88cb-6ba54ca99bbf data-caption="People often say that boyfriends do not deserve some benefits till they are married [Credit Black Excellence]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/j0UktkpTURBXy8zM2ZmNjgyMjFjMjU0ZDRmYmU4ZjliMTdmNGY1N2FkMS5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAlHCww></span><p><strong>But really, what does this even mean?</strong></p><p>The idea connotes that husbands deserve some benefits when they wife a woman, which boyfriends do not deserve until they do same.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Ok, cool. So let’s do a quick head-to-head. What are husbands supposed to get that boyfriends should be denied of?</p><p><strong>Boyfriend benefits versus husband benefits</strong></p><p>Whether married or not, being with a man presupposes your readiness to be faithful, to be kind, honest, to communicate appropriately, to care for your man and about him. These are unarguably basic relationship benefits a man gets in a relationship, and no one would raise an eyebrow if a woman exhibits these things with a man even when she’s yet to marry him.</p><p>That brings us to the elephant in the room; sex.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This writer likes to think that whenever people dredge up that rule that says ‘do not give husband benefits to boyfriends,’ their intention is to warn against premarital sex, since that is the only obvious thing that people usually hold back.&nbsp;I mean, given the realities of the society we live in and all the moral and religious influences that often shape our beliefs and behaviours, what else could the most obvious benefit of a marriage be, aside sex?</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6ea8fa17-83a4-483c-b7d8-336664619b8b data-caption="Many times, the benefit people exclude from a relationship before marriage is sex.

Everyone chooses to believe and practice what they feel is best for them and their relationship. That is pretty much settled and this article will not go further than that on the subject of premarital sex.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-153ca307-e83b-4bc0-b6de-c17001378deb data-caption="On premarital sex, people often make their own decisions to do it or to not do it.

Maybe it’s because that’s not how relationships are meant to work.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-f7a3325e-ed56-4f6d-90ba-9a6f54e1f5ec data-caption="Reciprocated efforts is all relationships are about.
