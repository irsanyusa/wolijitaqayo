Subjects of his tweets include his border wall, rants about the "Fake News" media, special counsel Robert Mueller's "Witch Hunt," and comments on other political leaders. The tweets often begin early in the morning, and, pundits have noticed, are often tied to whatever's being covered on Fox News.</p><p>McConney suggested that Trump should lighten up on the platform.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"[He] should go back to having more of a sense of humor about himself," McConney said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <span id=946d7df6-242b-3259-aa79-56393bd61157>The newest Obamacare enrollment numbers prove the health law is 'far from dead' despite repeated attacks from Trump and the GOP</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwwMeeZKaZnmLEqbuMrZiun5ipeqW7zZqjnWWkp8KuvIyhprBlpKR6tcPEnqtmq5GesW7Ax55knZmpYsGpsYypqZ6rmZmyr8CMnKaupJRiwrSxjnFrsm5hbr4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
