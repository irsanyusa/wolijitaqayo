I can go on and on. The government really needs to intervene and help regulate the price,” he said.</p><p><strong>Mrs Biodun Ajakaiye</strong>, a businesswoman, said the increase in the price of bread had led to a reduction in its consumption in her house.</p><p>“I used to buy two family loaves for my family of six and we used to eat bread twice a week but with the increase we now eat bread once a month.</p><p>“The last bread I bought was ₦1, 700. So two loaves for my family will be ₦3400. How can we spend that amount on only bread twice a week?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“We just had to advise ourselves and replace eating bread with Akamu and Akara,” she said.</p><p><strong>Mrs Ella Anyanwu</strong>, a civil servant, said the increase in bread price had affected her family’s consumption of it.</p><p>Anyanwu also said in spite of the increase, the quantity and quality of some bread had reduced and she called on the government to intervene.</p><p>“The price of bread increases geometrically and the quality and quantity also reduce daily. Some are not properly baked due to the high cost of baking items hence they spoil easily.</p><p>“A loaf of bread that was being sold between ₦950 to ₦1,000 early this year, increased to ₦1,300 then to ₦1,600 currently making affordability very difficult because one needs to buy like three loaves to meet the needs of my family.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“If bread that is a common food for a common man can be so expensive, how can Nigerians survive in this harsh economic situation?</p><p>“Therefore, the government should endeavour to look into the cause of its increasing cost as well as other food items and intervene to cushion the effect,” she said.</p><p>A trader, <strong>Musa Ahmed</strong>, said he still ate bread but went for the smaller sizes because of the price increase.</p><p>According to him, I used to buy a loaf of ₦500 bread but it is now ₦1,000, so I now buy the ₦400 loaf which used to be ₦300, and manage myself.</p><p><strong>Peace Samuel</strong>, a manager of one of the big bakeries in Abuja, attributed the increasing cost of bread to several factors, including the Ukraine war, foreign exchange increase, and inflation in the country.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“ Two to three months ago, our 900g family loaf was supplied to distributors at a rate of ₦930, while it was sold to final consumers at ₦1,100.</p><p>“But presently, the same loaf is supplied to distributors at ₦1,100 and sold to final consumers at ₦1,300.</p><p>“Similarly, the 1,200g Jumbo loaf that was sold to final consumers at ₦1,200 is now being sold for ₦1,600.”</p><p>Samuel, however, said in spite of the drop in the dollar, the cost of raw materials such as flour and others used to make bread was still on the rise.</p><p>“As of March 22, the price of flour has witnessed another increase of between ₦1,500 to ₦2,000, depending on the brand.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“This continuous surge in prices has led to many bakeries shutting down.”</p><p>She also said that suppliers sometimes create artificial scarcity and increase prices, knowing that customers have no choice but to buy.</p><p>According to her, this is harming the bakery business, and many people are losing their jobs.</p><p>Samuel recalled how the government’s intervention helped with the reduction in prices of flour when the Master Bakers Association went on a nationwide strike in February.</p><p>“When we went on the strike, the government intervened to an extent and the price of 50kg flour was reduced immediately from ₦55,000 to ₦50,000.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“However, the price has gone up again, ranging from ₦53,500 to ₦57,000, depending on the brand.</p><p>“The government needs to understand that the continuous rise in the cost of bread is creating a ripple effect that is affecting the entire economy, therefore, the government really needs to intervene,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyjvsSam2amn2K5sLrGnqlmmZabvLOwwJujnmWdlru6ecWcq2aqlai2pbHNrapmpJGisq%2FAjqado6Rhpb4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
