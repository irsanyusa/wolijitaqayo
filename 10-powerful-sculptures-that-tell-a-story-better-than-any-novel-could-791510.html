But it&nbsp;turns out that many of&nbsp;them have a&nbsp;deeper meaning, like an&nbsp;angel that is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;knives taken by&nbsp;the police, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;ginormous figures that tell&nbsp;us how a&nbsp;new life is&nbsp;born. Sculptures have a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;good <a href=# title=stories data-link=tag>stories</a> to&nbsp;share if&nbsp;you’re willing to&nbsp;listen.</p><p>Come with <strong>Bright Side</strong> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;little journey around the globe to&nbsp;see 9&nbsp;eloquent monuments and sculptures and learn the stories behind them.</p><p><h2>1. Knife Angel by&nbsp;Alfie Bradley has persuaded hundreds of&nbsp;people to&nbsp;give up&nbsp;violence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a2f/0f8/78980351adad3213b0c8c6b738.jpg><p>Alfie Bradley <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>created</a> this breathtaking 27-foot-high angel made of&nbsp;more than 100,000&nbsp;knives. These weapons were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>surrendered</a> to&nbsp;knife bins around the&nbsp;UK and were collected by&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK police, knife crime charities, action groups, and other people who were affected by&nbsp;knife crimes in&nbsp;one way or&nbsp;another. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Knife Angel</i></a> travels around the&nbsp;UK to&nbsp;educate people on&nbsp;how important the problem of&nbsp;knife crime is&nbsp;and how dangerous these weapons are.</p><p><h2>2. The Passer-Through-Walls by&nbsp;Jean Marais illustrates the final scene from a&nbsp;famous French novel.</h2></p><p>Le&nbsp;Passe-Muraille is&nbsp;a&nbsp;French novel by&nbsp;Marcel Aymé that tells the <a href=#>story</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;modest office worker who one day discovers that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;superpower&nbsp;— he&nbsp;can walk through walls! The hero uses his gift to&nbsp;the fullest to&nbsp;solve problems and becomes a&nbsp;burglar, gets into prison, and escapes until one day he&nbsp;loses his power right on&nbsp;his way through a&nbsp;wall and gets <a href=#>stuck</a> in&nbsp;it. This monument is&nbsp;also quite interactive&nbsp;— the man’s hands are polished by&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;people who try to&nbsp;help him get out of&nbsp;the wall.</p><p><h2>3. Building Bridges by&nbsp;Lorenzo Quinn shares a&nbsp;recipe for a&nbsp;better world.</h2></p><p>How do&nbsp;we&nbsp;make our world a&nbsp;better place to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in? <a href=# title=Friendship data-link=tag>Friendship</a>, wisdom, help, faith, hope, and <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>&nbsp;— these are the ingredients to&nbsp;a&nbsp;better world and happier people <a href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;Lorenzo Quinn, a&nbsp;famous Italian artist. These 6&nbsp;virtues are embodied in&nbsp;the 6&nbsp;pairs of&nbsp;hands that build a&nbsp;bridge together. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the latest works by&nbsp;Quinn that was <a href=#>built</a> for 2019’s Venice Art Biennale.</p><p><h2>4. Corporate Head by&nbsp;Terry Allen tells&nbsp;us about the danger of&nbsp;being focused on&nbsp;profit at&nbsp;all costs.</h2></p><p>The impressive life-sized bronze sculpture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man who has buried his head in&nbsp;the building resides in&nbsp;Los Angeles, California in&nbsp;the US. The sculpture <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>embodies</a> a&nbsp;businessman who has devoted his entire life to&nbsp;gaining profit for himself and the company he&nbsp;works for. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;separated from the office building only from his neck down, which means his thoughts have been completely absorbed by&nbsp;the establishment he&nbsp;works for.</p><p>The sculpture illustrates the modern pace of&nbsp;life where people have to&nbsp;carry an&nbsp;economic burden and spend their whole lives working in&nbsp;businesses, often missing out on&nbsp;things that are way more important than material wealth.</p><p><h2>5. Sphere Within a&nbsp;Sphere by&nbsp;Arnaldo Pomodoro reminds&nbsp;us of&nbsp;how fragile our planet&nbsp;is.</h2></p><p>This wonderful statue mesmerizes viewers with a&nbsp;complex structure of&nbsp;fractured spheres&nbsp;— the outer one and the inner one&nbsp;— and numerous intricate gears inside. The artist, Arnaldo Pomodoro, liked to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> simple geometrical forms in&nbsp;his work and managed to&nbsp;hide deep meaning behind those simple forms. The <i>Sphere Within a&nbsp;Sphere</i> once again <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reminds</a>&nbsp;us how everything in&nbsp;the universe is&nbsp;interconnected, how fragile our world&nbsp;is, and how easily it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;broken into pieces.</p><p><h2>6. The Man Who Measures the Clouds by&nbsp;Jan Fabre speaks about the struggles of&nbsp;measuring the immeasurable.</h2></p><p>This unique artwork with the gold leaf finishing touch is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;2019’s Venice Art Biennale and it&nbsp;<a href=#>shows</a> viewers a&nbsp;man rising to&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;29.5 feet (9&nbsp;meters) and trying to&nbsp;measure the clouds with a&nbsp;ruler. This sculpture can be&nbsp;<a href=#>interpreted</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person’s desperate attempt to&nbsp;make the impossible possible, as&nbsp;our never-ending striving to&nbsp;surpass ourselves as&nbsp;mankind, or&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nod to&nbsp;ancient philosophy that thought that human beings were the measure of&nbsp;all things.</p><p><h2>7. Inertia and The Bankers by&nbsp;Jason Decaires Taylor tackle social issues and call for our responsibility.</h2></p><p>The Bankers, Inertia and other marvelous underwater <a href=#>sculptures</a> by&nbsp;Jason Decaires Taylor reveal the most acute problems of&nbsp;modern society, like being obsessed with material wealth and being exposed to&nbsp;mass media’s influence. But apart from that, these unbelievable works serve as&nbsp;<a href=#>homes</a> for coral that are on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;extinction in&nbsp;many regions of&nbsp;our planet. By&nbsp;placing his masterpieces underwater in&nbsp;Mexico, the Bahamas, and other places, the artist tries to&nbsp;attract more attention to&nbsp;global climate changes and the things we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;to&nbsp;protect the earth.</p><p><h2>8. Absorbed by&nbsp;Light by&nbsp;Gali Lucas and Karoline Hinz honestly tell&nbsp;us how obsessed we’ve become with gadgets and technology.</h2></p><p>3&nbsp;people sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bench, absorbed by&nbsp;their smartphones so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that they don’t even notice each other. What could illustrate our era better? The installation that was part of&nbsp;the Amsterdam Light Festival <a href=#>symbolizes</a> how modern technology connects and disconnects&nbsp;us at&nbsp;the same time. When you walk at&nbsp;night next time, look around and you’ll see the same picture&nbsp;— dozens of&nbsp;people all around with their faces lit up&nbsp;by&nbsp;their mobile phones. We&nbsp;actually are absorbed by&nbsp;these lights, aren’t we?</p><p><h2>9. <i>The Miraculous Journey</i> by&nbsp;Damien Hirst shows the stages of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby’s growth in&nbsp;the womb.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ba/1bc/6b288a59b18d0474ec3bce7f7a.jpg><p>Abd Rabbo Ammar / ABACA / Abaca / East News</p><p>This amazing monument located outside the Sidra Medical and Research Center in&nbsp;Doha, Qatar, consists of&nbsp;14&nbsp;large-scale bronze sculptures, each of&nbsp;them <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>showing</a> a&nbsp;stage of&nbsp;an&nbsp;embryo’s growth in&nbsp;the womb from conception to&nbsp;birth. Being extremely explicit and bold, <i>The Miraculous Journey</i> evoked controversial feelings in&nbsp;the Eastern audience and was even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>covered</a> from public view for some time.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these monuments would you like to&nbsp;see with your own eyes? Can you share with&nbsp;us a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sculpture or&nbsp;a&nbsp;monument that impressed you?</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in July 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p>Preview photo credit Abd Rabbo Ammar / ABACA / Abaca / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xec%2Borp6qlqq5br%2FCrqOprKWnsrR506GYrWWkmrmtecBmqq2noq56o7HTrZyrZaSdrq95wKewZqafq7KtecKorKWcXWyGcoGQaWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
