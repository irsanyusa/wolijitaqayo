Calling his family and relationship with his wife Behati Prinsloo a “gift,” the star professed that his home life actually means more to him than even his wildly successful music career.</p><p>“I don’t know how you can have a better life.” Levine said. “Having both music and family is just a gift, and I think you don’t appreciate sh*t like that until you get a little older.”</p><p>As he and Maroon 5 balance working on new music and prepping for Vegas, Levine remains cognizant of how rare his situation is.
