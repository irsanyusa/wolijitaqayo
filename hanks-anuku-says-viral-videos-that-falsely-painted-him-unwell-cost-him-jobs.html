In response, Anuku explained that he was only trying to get himself into character for a role.</p><p>He began, "That day I was trying to get into character for a role I was going to play, a madman role. Someone who was not in his correct senses or right frame of mind."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"So naturally I did it in the neighbourhood and I was trying to get it to show the way the director would have shown it. I was meditating and trying to get into character, that's it. I was not even aware that I was being recorded. I was concentrating on myself and my script," he continued.</p><p>Addressing the insanity rumours which once plagued the internet, Anuku emphasised that he <a href=# id=d956fb93-19f1-4c35-a23e-df331512f43c data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>was never on drugs</a> and is in fact very healthy.</p><p>"People have said a lot of stuff. Rumours are rumours. They said I was sick and I was on drugs. I was not on drugs. Maybe they saw me depressed cause depression can cause stress. But me, being on drugs? That's not true. I'm not a madman. I'm very sane and healthy. I exercise a lot and do my martial arts and sports," he explained.</p><p>He revealed that he was greatly affected by the viral videos and subsequent rumours. He said, "I lost a lot of money. I lost jobs and was jobless for a while and people didn't care about me. I went through pain and I was heartbroken."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGahmZ6gwG6tza6irmWjlsa0edWiqZqkXau2pbHOrGStoJGpeqety6ycpbFdpa6qutOem2agmaJ6trrWnqOlZZOkwLV5x6KkZqKfl8BwgY%2Bkq56jqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
