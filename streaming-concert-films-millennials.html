Fans of Taylor Swift who were not able to snag a coveted ticket to the singer’s upcoming Eras Tour can always hope for the next best thing: One of her performances gets neatly packaged into a concert film.
As part of an increasingly common genre accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, pop stars ranging from Swift and Beyoncé to The Weeknd and the 1975 all have released filmed versions of recent concerts onto streaming services."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s the closest thing to being at a show without being there —&nbsp;and some fans probably prefer it. Behind-the-scenes music documentaries have followed, often accompanying or built into the filmed concerts.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s all part of a recent “rockumentary revolution,” said Justin Lacob, head of development at XTR, an entertainment studio that produces documentaries. Netflix Inc., Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and the Walt Disney Co. have spent tens of millions of dollars on music films and related content for their respective streaming platforms. Elton John’s “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>sold</a> to Disney+ for around $30 million, while Apple TV+ <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>bought</a> “Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry” for $25 million. Five years ago, “these numbers would have been completely unheard of,” Lacob said.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But there’s a reason for the genre’s pricey figures. Americans — and especially millennials — generally like it.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">New Morning Consult data found that more than half of U.S. adults (58%) are interested in documentaries about musicians, while nearly half (48%) are interested in concert films. The majority of millennials, meanwhile, said they would sign up for a streaming service if one of their favorite musicians were to release a concert on that platform.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Millennials are fine to watch concerts from the couch</strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Roughly half of millennials (52%) said filmed concerts are an adequate substitute to attending in person, compared with 45% of Gen Xers and 42% of baby boomers. Gen Zers were least likely to agree with the statement, at 37%.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Rock (59%), pop (54%) and country (45%) concert films were the genres in which adults were most interested.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The “rockumentary revolution” lives on</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Some fans will turn to these streaming films if they can’t afford the higher price attached to concert tickets, especially during a potential recession, Lacob said. He added that viewers often want to see behind-the-scenes and archival footage of musicians, pointing to documentaries like Disney+’s “The Beatles: Get Back” and Netflix’s “Miss Americana” about Swift. “They’re gaining intimate access,” Lacob said.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">HBO is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>already touting</a> the success of “The Weeknd: Live at SoFi Stadium,” which premiered last month, and the genre is filling up streaming services’ release calendars this year. On Friday, Disney+ will <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>premiere</a> “Miley Cyrus – Endless Summer Vacation (Backyard Sessions),” which may resonate with younger viewers (read: millennials) who grew up with Cyrus on the Disney Channel. The premiere of “Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert” <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>drew</a> 5.9 million viewers on the channel in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The March 3-5, 2023, </i><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>survey</i></a><i> was conducted among a representative sample of 2,200 U.S. adults, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOrKurnZGitq%2BzjJymp5uVp8FussilpKxlnZ65rbHNp6CapKM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
