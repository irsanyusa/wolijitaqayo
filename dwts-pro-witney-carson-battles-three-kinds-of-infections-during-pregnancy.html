The process of going through pregnancy has its struggles though, and for Carson, it’s with battling the infections.</p><p>Carson shared on her Instagram that she is currently suffering from a sinus infection, strep throat, and a urinary tract infection. It is alarming to have all three kinds of infection at the same time, especially when a person is currently pregnant.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to post that I was sick, but this is actually too crazy that I have three infections and I am 17 weeks pregnant,” Carson said. “I feel so much better today. I’ve been on my antibiotics for a few days now, so hopefully not contagious anymore.”</p><p>The infections are getting better at the moment as Carson provides treatment for herself, but she remains cautious of accidentally passing anything to her 1-year-old son Leo. The DWTS pro remains hopeful that the infections will go away by the time Christmas day comes along.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Carson Shared Photo of Baby Bump at 17 Weeks</h2><p>Prior to getting sick, Carson updated her followers on her 17-week pregnancy with a video featuring the song “Sweet Nothing,” by Taylor Swift. The fans are just as excited as Carson to know the gender of the bundle of joy that will be arriving in 2023.</p><p>Carson announced her pregnancy at the show’s semi-finals, saying she believed it was the best time to tell the DWTS family. She’s not the only one who’s pregnant though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Arnold</a>, a professional dancer, is having her second child with her husband, Sam Cusick.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniella Karagach</a> and her husband, Pasha Pashkov, are expecting their first child to arrive next year.
