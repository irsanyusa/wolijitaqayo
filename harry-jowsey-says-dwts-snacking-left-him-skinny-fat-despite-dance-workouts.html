He blames the overflowing craft services stocked with treats.</p><p>According to Jowsey, the abundance of snacks like candy, muffins, and other goodies proved too tempting. He constantly indulged between rehearsals, undermining his activity level.</p><p>Jowsey says having food around causes him to “find any excuse” to nosh rather than practice dancing. His weakness for snacking resulted in noticeable weight gain and loss of muscle tone.</p><p>With the DWTS tour starting soon, Jowsey is now trying to return to peak physical form. He describes attempting to incorporate more activity through step tracking and workouts with a trainer.</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jowsey</a> jokingly admits he still avoids classic strength moves like squats and lunges. He quips that despite training his skinny legs remain stubbornly toothpick-like.</p><p>Unlike Jowsey, fellow competitor Alyson Hannigan dropped 20 pounds during her DWTS season thanks to rigorous rehearsals. She highlighted her transformation in an Instagram post. Jowsey pokes fun at his own physique, suggesting he may need to just accept his body’s limitations. He lacks natural athleticism but enjoys entertaining crowds regardless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-live-tour-stint-reunites-jowsey-with-pro-partner-rylee-arnold>Live Tour Stint Reunites Jowsey with Pro Partner Rylee Arnold</h2><p>Jowsey joins the DWTS tour in late February as a special guest performer.

However, he conveyed excitement about connecting with supporters from the show in person.</p><p>Despite lackluster dancing skills, Jowsey’s cheeky rapport with Arnold helped attract young viewers. Their natural comedic chemistry likely factored into his tour invitation.</p><p>Jowsey embraces his role as a novice dancer there to entertain. While other pros showcase technical brilliance, he represents DWTS‘ playful spirit. His self-aware humor adds accessible elements fans identify with.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_JohnLegend_ChrissyTiegen_Paul-MorigiGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Chrissy Teigen Recalls “Terrifying” Credit Card Moment During Dinner Date with John Legend" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x5qpq7Fdn7y4v8SyZKyZqah6pcPTrGSsppGYuKq6xmajnp6kYrWquYysoqKmnq56p63TZpueq6CewaZ5w5qlnJ1drLyzt86uq6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
