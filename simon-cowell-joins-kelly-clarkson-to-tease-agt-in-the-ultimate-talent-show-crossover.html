He knew that after breaking your back, you’re not supposed to move, but decided to drag himself to his bedroom.</p><p>As he was bleeding and about to pass out, EMTs arrived. He now reflects on a funny moment where he thought he was hallucinating that there was a girl in his room, but really, she was just there to give him a COVID-19 test. The music mogul went into the hospital that night for a surgery he recalls was seven or eight hours. He called the doctor who performed the surgery “the most kind, amazing, smart person you’ll ever meet.”</p><p>During this time, Clarkson filled in for Cowell on the ‘AGT’ judging panel. Cowell got to watch Clarkson’s big debut on the show and praised her.</p><p>“You almost did too well Kelly,” he said.</p><p>Cowell knew that if Clarkson was available she would not hesitate to step in for him on the show. She meshed really well with the other judges and even flexed her British accent behind the scenes. Cowell tried to do a country accent on The Kelly Clarkson and lowkey sounded like he was impersonating Shelton.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cowell-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-changed-his-life>Cowell Reflects on How Becoming a Father Changed His Life</h2><p>Shifting gears, Clarkson brought up Cowell’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wishfits book series </a>that he is doing with Eric. He’s not the same guy she met at the American Idol auditions back in 2002.</p><p>“After I lost my parents, I genuinely felt Kelly, I would never feel that kind of love for anyone ever again until I saw the scan of him for the first time,” the 61-year-old said. “I can’t imagine my life without him. He’s the most amazing thing that ever happened to me.”</p><p>Eric may <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have a future as a talent show judge</a> on one of Cowell’s many shows. Cowell teased <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 16</a> of AGT and applauded all of the contestants who came onto the show because they all have a positive attitude. He even said that for many of the acts on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming season,</a> they developed their acts during quarantine amid the pandemic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“There are some amazing stories you’re going to see and then there are some wacky acts but I love that combination,” he said.</p><p>After being in the entertainment industry for years, it’s no surprise that some of Cowell’s favorite acts to see are singers. The hardest acts for him to watch are always comedians because of the silence of the crowd. He was happy to find out that Clarkson has adopted some of his judging techniques over on The Voice. She called herself a mixture of Cowell and Paula Abdul. He applauded her for becoming <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">such a star over the years </a>after they first met on American Idol.</p><p>“You’re one of the nicest people I’ve ever met,” Cowell said. “Most loyal, I can say that because we’ve known each other a long time. If people ever say what advice you can give me, I say ‘follow Kelly,'” Simon added.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Thumbnail_PhotoByTraePattonAndEricMcCandless_NBCUniversalMediaVillage.jpgDisneyGEC.jpg alt="Kenzie Wheeler Puts the Honky-Tonk in Chayce Beckham’s Country Rock" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>simon cowell</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKOnmaPAbrfEpaOyZZOhrrO30qilZqyfYsGmrdKeZJqfpGK2r3nToZxmrZyptq6t055krZmcmru1edKhprBlk6e8tL%2FOr5yrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
