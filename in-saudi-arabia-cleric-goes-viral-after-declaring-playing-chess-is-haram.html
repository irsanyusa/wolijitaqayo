Independent UK reported.</p><p>“Many things are said to be illegal and religiously banned in Saudi,” Mr Thaily wrote on Twitter, sharing photos of United Arab Emirates dignitaries at Saudi Chess Association events.</p><p>He noted that many religious prohibitions are not enforced in Saudi Arabia, adding that “religious society banned public music festivals but they’re everywhere”.</p><p>“The Saudi Chess Association has put great efforts in chess popularity and will continue holding events everywhere unless forced otherwise.”, He added.</p><p>It is unlikely that Sheikh’s ruling will be enforced, and more plausible that chess will be relegated to the status of other minor vices, such as music, which many in the clerical establishment frown upon.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Moreover, since the ruling was in response to a specific question, it was probably meant as an advisory opinion rather than a formal edict.
