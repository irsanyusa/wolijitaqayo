The first was installed in Portsmouth, England, followed by another ball in Greenwich, the namesake of Greenwich Mean Time, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that timekeeping ball</a> is still dropped every day.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first American time ball <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was installed atop</a> the United States Naval Observatory in Washington D.C. in 1845.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Times Square tradition started because of a fireworks ban&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The New York Times started the modern-day tradition of dropping a ball on a pole to mark the beginning of the new year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the official Times Square website said.</a> Crowds had already been coming to Times Square, named after the newspaper’s skyscraper, to celebrate the new year, but a fireworks ban in 1907 threw a wrench in that plan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Instead, the newspaper’s owner Adolph Ochs commissioned Ukrainian immigrant and metalworker Jacob Starr to create an illuminated 700 lbs (317 kg) iron and wood ball to be lowered from the flagpole of the Times Tower.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ball was lowered by hand before midnight and then an electrician turned a switch to light up a sign displaying the numbers of the year in lights, a novelty at the time,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Starr’s granddaughter told CNN. </a>Waiters in nearby establishments also wore battery-powered “1908” top hats that they lit up at midnight.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The tradition took a two-year break&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ball went out of commission for two years, in 1942 and 1943, during World War II, Times Square’s website said. Crowds still gathered for a minute of silence followed by chimes ringing from trucks parked at the Times Tower.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The ball weighs more than a car&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The modern day ball stretches 12 ft. (three and a half meters) in diameter and weighs 11,875 lbs (5,386 kg). That’s between two to three times as much as the average weight of a car in the U.S. in 2022, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ball’s not the only heavy item on stage</a>—the four numerals to spell out 2024 together also weigh approximately 1,160 lbs (526 kg). The “0” weighs in at 380 lbs. (172 kg), the “2” at 250 lbs. (113 kg), and the “4” at 280 lbs. (127).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>It takes hundreds of workers hours to clean up after the event</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year, 200 sanitation workers are expected to hit the streets and take about six hours to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clean up the confetti and trash left behind</a> by the crowds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Literally tons of trash accumulates, with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NYC Department of Sanitation telling Untapped New York</a> that it picked up more than 60 tons (60,000 kg) of confetti, big party hats, noisemakers, sunglasses and more over the 2021 to 2022 New Year’s Eve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1245915832.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The ball’s crystals have special meanings&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The ball is covered with 2,688 crystal triangles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">made by Waterford Crystal</a>, measuring between four and six inches (10 to 15 cm) per side, according to the Times Square website. They are then bolted to 672 LED modules and illuminated by 32,256 LEDs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Each crystal triangle has a special pattern with a different meaning, featuring 192 each of nine symbols—the Gift of Love overlapping hearts, the Gift of Wisdom a wheel, the Gift of Happiness a sun image, the Gift of Goodwill three pineapples, the Gift of Harmony a small rosette, the Gift of Serenity butterflies above a meadow, the Gift of Kindness a circle of rosettes, the Gift Of Wonder a faceted starburst and the Gift of Fortitude diamond cuts on either side of a crystal pillar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The remaining 960 Gift of Imagination triangles are a series of intricate wedge cuts.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Wishes written on confetti are dropped from rooftops&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At midnight, 3,000 lbs. (1,360 kg) of confetti is dropped from the rooftops of buildings <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over Times Square by hundreds of volunteers.</a> Anyone in or visiting New York City was welcome to pen their wish and put it on a “Wishing Wall” before Dec. 25. People across the world were able to get involved prior to Dec. 28 by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">submitting a wish online</a>, which would then be printed on confetti ahead of New Year’s Eve.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Revelers pay up to $12,500 to eat at a restaurant with a view&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While it’s free to stand in Times Square and watch the ball drop, restaurants on the square are offering steep packages for food and a view from the warmth of their establishments.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Marriott Marquis hotel charges $12,500</a> for its Prime VIP Couple's Package, which offers an open bar, dinner buffet, hors d'oeuvres, a bottle of champagne and guaranteed seating next to floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto Times Square.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even family-friendly chain staple Olive Garden is<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> charging $450 </a>for its New Year’s Eve party, with a buffet, open bar, DJ and dancing, and champagne toast.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Some people take drastic measures to ensure they maintain their viewing spot</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There are no portable restrooms in Times Square</a> for the event, leaving revelers on their own to find a restroom. Restaurants likely won’t let thousands of people in to use the toilet for free without buying something, and leaving could mean losing a viewing spot someone waited hours in line to get. The result? People have said they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wear adult diapers.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Security is tight, especially this year&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Everyone coming into the square goes through security screening. The New York Police Department uses 1,200 security cameras for the event and stations thousands of officers in Times Square, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">real estate website 6sqft</a> reported.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Security is especially tight this year, after a 19-year-old man with a machete<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> injured three police officers last year</a> near Times Square. The prosecutors who charged him said he committed the attack “in the name of radical Islamic jihad.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the FBI has issued a general warning about the threat of violence</a> at New Year’s Eve and other festive winter holiday events because of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel-Hamas war</a>. The NYPD expanded its security screening zone to also prepare for potential protests related to the war, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Gothamist reported.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWVmf3Z%2FjqecsGWpmq6zv4yerZ5lpJ66pr%2BMrKiumaKaeqOty6VknaqfpXqnrcKtqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
