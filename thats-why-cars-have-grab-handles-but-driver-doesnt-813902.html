I&nbsp;call it&nbsp;the “OH&nbsp;NO!!!” handle. It’s there to&nbsp;give you something to&nbsp;hold onto when your grandma decides to&nbsp;go&nbsp;full NASCAR! These handles are actually especially useful, all jokes aside. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people need a&nbsp;little extra help getting in&nbsp;and out of&nbsp;the car.</p><p>As&nbsp;for why the driver’s door usually doesn’t have one, there are a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;reasons. For one, the steering wheel can function as&nbsp;a&nbsp;makeshift grab-handle! Drivers might also be&nbsp;inclined to&nbsp;grab the handle while driving. Not safe! Modern car keys have a&nbsp;nice trick up&nbsp;their sleeve... if&nbsp;they had sleeves.</p><p>They can control your windows! Try holding the unlock button on&nbsp;your car keys for a&nbsp;few seconds. There’s a&nbsp;chance that after 5&nbsp;seconds, your car windows will magically open. If&nbsp;you hold the lock button again, your windows should close. Only a&nbsp;few special people actually use this cool trick. Check out your owner’s manual... your car might be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the lucky ones!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e18/529/6b9b3c5c3ea16992e6f71b69b4.png><p>If&nbsp;your <a href=# title=internet data-link=tag>internet</a> goes down, and you REALLY need that gaming fix... Google has you covered. You click on&nbsp;your favorite shortcut, and disaster. The dreaded message appears: “Unable to&nbsp;connect to&nbsp;the Internet”.</p><p>But wait, what’s that little pixilated dinosaur next to&nbsp;it? Instead of&nbsp;panicking, press that space bar! This little game has become a&nbsp;huge hit, and it’s a&nbsp;lot more addictive than it&nbsp;looks. A&nbsp;dinosaur jumping over a&nbsp;cactus, genius!</p><p>During the colder months, putting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beanie can mean the difference between staying home or&nbsp;going outside! And you can thank French sailors for the pompom on&nbsp;top. This was to&nbsp;stop them from banging their heads on&nbsp;those pesky beams down below. Ow!<strong> </strong>Fast-forward a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;decades... now everyone’s wearing them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5a1/151/c210455336be123f6ad0d56481.png><p>Next time you’re on&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight, look above each window... you’ll notice some little triangles sitting there! They’re there to&nbsp;show the flight crew the best spots to&nbsp;view the plane’s flaps through the window! If&nbsp;you’re worried about a&nbsp;little air sickness ruining your flight, try to&nbsp;choose a&nbsp;seat that’s located between these triangles.</p><p>Sitting between the wings puts you in&nbsp;the direct center of&nbsp;the plane and offers the smoothest possible ride. Sitting at&nbsp;a&nbsp;long traffic light usually makes me&nbsp;hungry, bored, and a&nbsp;little curious.</p><p>Have you ever thought about those black dots and that black line all along the edges of&nbsp;your windshield? It&nbsp;looks cool enough, but come&nbsp;on, it’s got to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;hidden use, right? Well, the black line is&nbsp;called a&nbsp;Frit, and it’s there to&nbsp;help your windshield from popping out of&nbsp;the car! Pretty important I’d say!</p><p>Microwavable instant rice loves to&nbsp;fall over in&nbsp;the microwave if&nbsp;you’re me&nbsp;that&nbsp;is. And like&nbsp;me, you’ve probably struggled with keeping the package upright. As&nbsp;it&nbsp;turns out, the flaps that fold out from the bottom create a&nbsp;nice, sturdy base. Push them out and give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;try! Hey, why didn’t I&nbsp;learn this in&nbsp;school?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4e9/24a/ad587c5969861da25d56c9e952.png><p>Has that half-finished, two-liter bottle of&nbsp;<a href=# title=soda data-link=tag>soda</a>, leftover from pizza night gone flat? Rather than pouring it&nbsp;down the drain, add it&nbsp;to&nbsp;your compost heap! The sugar feeds good microorganisms and increases the acidity of&nbsp;the pile, helping organic material break down faster!</p><p>Any pair of&nbsp;scissors will go&nbsp;blunt sooner or&nbsp;later, but don’t let that stop you! There’s a&nbsp;product in&nbsp;your kitchen that can help bring them back to&nbsp;life, fast! Aluminum Foil isn’t just for left-over lasagna. Fold a&nbsp;sheet of&nbsp;it&nbsp;into quarters and start cutting! Cutting through the foil will sharpen those scissors right&nbsp;up, but not if&nbsp;they’re too blunt. Rescue them while there’s still time!</p><p>Those little escalator brushes aren’t there to&nbsp;clean your shoes, even though they can do&nbsp;a&nbsp;rather good job! These bristles are actually a&nbsp;serious safety feature! Without them, clothes, shoelaces, and bags can get caught in&nbsp;them when they’re too close to&nbsp;the sides! The little brushes are also there to&nbsp;tickle you to&nbsp;remind you to&nbsp;look down and take care. Hey, I&nbsp;always thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bug rubbing up&nbsp;against&nbsp;me!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a23/f3b/216a695a1b8331d2896dc04b2f.png><p>Half belts. Seriously, what is&nbsp;up&nbsp;with those things? Well, some military jackets used to&nbsp;double as&nbsp;blankets and the half-belt helped keep the extra material from getting in&nbsp;the soldier’s way. Nowadays, they’re mostly used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fashion accessory.</p><p>Accidentally stapling the wrong pages together is&nbsp;like, the worst thing ever! Well there are the worst things, but it’s certainly annoying. Especially if&nbsp;the staple takes out a&nbsp;huge piece of&nbsp;your document with it&nbsp;when you try to&nbsp;pry it&nbsp;off! There’s actually a&nbsp;simple way to&nbsp;make sure that the stapler pins are less tight, and easier to&nbsp;pull out.</p><p>Take a&nbsp;closer look at&nbsp;that metal plate at&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;your stapler, known as&nbsp;the anvil! Turn the stapler upside down and adjust the settings. You’re basically changing the stapler setting to&nbsp;“temporary”. No&nbsp;more tears, no&nbsp;more tears!</p><p>Toilet seat covers have been used wrong for way too long! I&nbsp;see you ripping off that flap that looks like a&nbsp;tongue... no&nbsp;you’re doing it&nbsp;all wrong! Instead of&nbsp;tearing it&nbsp;off, let the flap sit in&nbsp;the bowl after you put down the cover. When you flush, the suction will pull on&nbsp;the flap, and take it&nbsp;away!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0f5/1a4/1c51f75560afc5d6b5729f9135.png><p>That dark square or&nbsp;rectangle at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;your toothpaste tube... what does that mean? Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;color-coded to&nbsp;show what ingredients are in&nbsp;there, or&nbsp;does it&nbsp;show whether the toothpaste’s synthetic or&nbsp;natural? Well, sorry, but the truth isn’t that exciting. The markings are there for the assembly machines. They help the machines know where to&nbsp;cut and fold each tube.</p><p>We’ve all driven home from the supermarket, taken a&nbsp;right turn a&nbsp;little too hard and... crash! Sounds like a&nbsp;groceries volcano just erupted in&nbsp;the trunk! Look closely in&nbsp;the trunk... you might see some little hooks in&nbsp;there! You can hang your bags on&nbsp;them! Oooh! Yeah, some cars have them behind the front seats instead. You can use them to&nbsp;hang clothes or&nbsp;even your take-out bag!</p><p>You may have noticed that members of&nbsp;the flight crew like to&nbsp;touch the overhead compartments while they’re walking down the aisle. They don’t have a&nbsp;weird desire to&nbsp;touch everything, there are actually handles along the edges to&nbsp;give them a&nbsp;better grip while walking!</p><p>Go&nbsp;ahead and use them the next time you feel like a&nbsp;mid-air stroll. It’s definitely better than grabbing onto everyone’s headrests! Don’t you hate that? A&nbsp;shiny brass doorknob adds just the right amount of&nbsp;fancy to&nbsp;your front door, but that’s not all it&nbsp;does!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/efd/538/b8a86458f4b28b6fa192dda7d9.png><p>Brass, like anything with copper alloy in&nbsp;it, has antimicrobial properties that many harmful germs and bacteria just can’t stand! In&nbsp;high traffic areas, these brass knobs and handles are the perfect way to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;those nasty germs, without having to&nbsp;use harsh chemicals all the time. The only downside is&nbsp;that brass is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot more expensive than other metals, that might be&nbsp;why it’s hardly used for this anymore. Does your toothbrush have a&nbsp;pattern of&nbsp;blue bristles weaved in&nbsp;with the white ones?</p><p>It&nbsp;makes the toothbrush look a&nbsp;lot more stylish, but it’s not just about looking good, those bristles actually have a&nbsp;practical purpose! The blue dye is&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;wear off, around the same time as&nbsp;when you should replace your toothbrush. You should be&nbsp;switching out your toothbrush every 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;4&nbsp;months anyway, but those blue bristles are there to&nbsp;give you a&nbsp;gentle nudge, just in&nbsp;case you forget!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f7e/950/46d0fa5db4af521c525b289c60.png><p>Now, you walk over them every day, and never think about it&nbsp;twice. But, is&nbsp;there a&nbsp;reason maintenance hole covers are always round? In&nbsp;past civilizations, like Ancient Rome, these covers used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;square-shaped slabs of&nbsp;stone. But all those edges and gaps led to&nbsp;plenty of&nbsp;stubbed toes and accidents for unsuspecting Romans. A&nbsp;round cover eliminated the problem. Plus it&nbsp;meant that you could only open it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;specialized tool, probably a&nbsp;good idea!</p><p>The thermos was invented by&nbsp;a&nbsp;Scottish scientist, but not for keeping his coffee warm! He&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;keep some chemicals at&nbsp;a&nbsp;stable temperature. He&nbsp;placed a&nbsp;small bottle inside of&nbsp;a&nbsp;larger one, and then sucked all the air out from between the two bottles. This same technique is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;make the modern thermos!</p><p>You can find a&nbsp;pin cushion in&nbsp;just about every household, and strangely, it’s always in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tomato! Ever wondered about that little strawberry dangling from the top? I’m no&nbsp;biologist, but I’m quite sure that strawberries don’t grow on&nbsp;tomatoes! That little thing’s for the needle you’re currently using, so&nbsp;you don’t lose it&nbsp;in&nbsp;that big pile you have!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/107/904/52bcdd50b69233308112d3dfe5.png><p>Stick deodorants go&nbsp;to&nbsp;waste when the casing starts rubbing against your skin, but there’s still plenty left in&nbsp;there! Here’s an&nbsp;easy trick to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;out. Unscrew the bottom and push it&nbsp;up&nbsp;from underneath. That’ll give you a&nbsp;few more days at&nbsp;least! Some people still drive off from the gas station with the hose shoved in&nbsp;their gas tank! Oh&nbsp;boy.</p><p>Luckily, gas companies figured out a&nbsp;solution. If&nbsp;you happen to&nbsp;drive off with the hose still in&nbsp;there, there’s a&nbsp;magnetic connector that disengages when pulled! That way you don’t take the pump with you, now that’d be&nbsp;embarrassing!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/531/6d5/8dd8775e5ba407b4f0759fdf66.png><p>Opening jars can be&nbsp;tough, even for the strongest person. I&nbsp;need a&nbsp;pickle, stat, aaaagh! Luckily, there’s a&nbsp;solution.</p><p>Pop on&nbsp;some rubber gloves! These gloves aren’t simply great for cleaning, they’ll give you the extra grip you need to&nbsp;open even the toughest of&nbsp;containers! Now your life is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;little bit better. You’re welcome.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGprdOsZLCgqWKwor7SZp%2BarpVitLOtwWafmqaUobK0ecGuq2acop7Dpr6Mnaaeq56penl9knJna2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
