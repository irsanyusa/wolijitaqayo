So I am thinking, ’Why, why? Why do you need to do that?'" Kris went on.</p><p>Admitting about the first time when she got hints about Kylie's injections, Kris said, "I got really upset. And then it was done, and I had to let it go. Once that was done, it’s just my kid. I love my kid. We make mistakes."</p><p>Meanwhile, Kylie, who is currently working on her whole lip kit, explained to Galore magazine that:</p><p>"I just put in my order for how many of them I want produced from my manufacturer. I was struggling with the number to ask them to make because I was like, ‘Do I want to make this much?’ No, because nobody is going to buy it. I didn’t want to order that much. But then my mom was like, ‘Kylie, people are going to want your lip kit.’ I guess sometimes that’s all I need to not get nervous."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, if Kris Jenner never approved of her minor daughter to get lip fillers, who did? Isn't the doctore [or whoever] that did it be in trouble with the authorities?</p><p>Do you believe Kris Jenner?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGakqpmoequxzaecq2WZYrGqsM2tZJqooKe8t7GMpLCloZVit6a6zZ6prGWcnr1ussilo56qo2SBuX%2BVcKSz</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
