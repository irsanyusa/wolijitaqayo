The coach waited until the final Battle to finally push his button, which ruined some of the suspense, since we knew that neither of the singers would be eliminated.</p><p>Tuesday’s episode also featured two battles pitting groups against solo singers. One of the groups made it through to the Knockouts, while the other was unfortunately eliminated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-groups-give-it-their-all-in-final-battles>‘The Voice’ Groups Give It Their All in Final Battles</h2><p>The first Battle of the night was between the trio KCK3 and Ryleigh Plank, on Team Ariana. They sang “Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)” by Christina Aguilera in a powerhouse performance that Grande described as “perfect for their voices.”</p><p>With the help of Grande and her advisor Kristin Chenoweth, all four ladies had their chance to shine. The coaches praised both sides of the performance, but they especially loved how Ryleigh owned the stage. Ultimately, Grande chose her as the winner of the Battle, meaning KCK3 sadly had to go home without being saved or stolen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>ARIANA GRANDE PROVES SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE’S DOING DURING ‘THE VOICE’ BATTLE ROUND</a></strong></p><p>Luckily, the next group to perform fared much better. The Cunningham Sisters went up against Parker McKay on Team Kelly, singing “It’s My Party” by Lesley Gore and bringing a new, modern emotion to the classic song. Once again, both sides of the Battle delivered incredible performances, as Shelton advised Clarkson to quit the show rather than choose between them.</p><p>Ultimately, Clarkson chose to keep the Cunningham Sisters on her team. At just 14 and 15 years old, they’ve shown seriously impressive talent that could take them far in the competition. Unfortunately, we had to say goodbye to Parker McKay, as Shelton didn’t choose to steal her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-uses-his-steal-in-the-final-battle-of-the-season>Blake Shelton Uses His Steal in the Final Battle of the Season</h3><p>It’s likely that Paris Winningham and Jonathan Mouton of Team Legend weren’t actually the last Battle when the show filmed, but they were the last one The Voice aired. Since Shelton was the only coach with a steal left, we knew that neither one of them would be eliminated.</p><p>The singers paired up on a cover of “Here and Now” by Luther Vandross, and they were both so good that the coaches couldn’t decide who should win. Clarkson said she was playing ping pong while watching them, while Shelton said their performance sounded like a record.</p><p>Legend said his decision was close to a coin toss, but he chose Paris because of his energy. As Jonathan prepared to leave the stage, Grande whispered to Shelton that he should steal him. He ended up listening to her, hitting his button and shocking the singer with his steal. Shelton said he would have chosen either singer if they were available.</p><p>That wraps up the Battles for Season 21. The Knockouts will start next Monday night on NBC with Mega Mentor Ed Sheeran.
