Four hardcore Redskins fans signed up to be in an upcoming episode of the Daily Show, knowing they were likely to be mocked in an interview with correspondent Jason Jones, the Washington Post reports. But three hours into the taping, a large group of Native American activists—prearranged by Daily Show producers to confront the Redskins fans—appeared, and the segment descended into vitriol."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At first there was an awkward silence. Then, the Native Americans angrily accused the fans of supporting a racist mascot. One activist, Amanda Blackhorse said she called a fan an “alcoholic, someone who’s in denial and who doesn’t want to believe what they’re doing is not right.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A 56-year-old Redskins fan, Kelli O’Dell, said she felt trapped, broke into tears and took off her microphone to leave the room.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This goes way beyond mocking. Poking fun is one thing, but that’s not what happened,” O’Dell said. “It was disingenuous. The Native Americans accused me of things that were so wrong. I felt in danger. I didn’t consent to that. I am going to be defamed.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Daily Show told the Redskins fans that there would be a panel with Native Americans, but was unclear about whether there would be a cross-panel discussion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Native Americans took flak as they were being filmed for The Daily Show at the FedEx Field on Sunday, where Redskins fans tailgating an NFL season opener shouted obscenities at them. According to one of the Native Americans, one man shouted at them “Thanks a lot for letting us use your name, boys!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Redskins name and logo have long been a subject of controversy, with Native American groups filing successive lawsuits claiming the name is disparaging. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office voted to cancel the Redskins trademark, but its owner, Dan Snyder, has adamantly refused to change the team’s name.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Daily Show episode in question hasn’t aired yet.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">[<a href=# rel=noopener>Washington Post</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbGBtgnKFjp2YoqSpYsCpu9ZmpZqsmauybq3Mnqmim5GjwG6%2BxJ2qpKGeqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
