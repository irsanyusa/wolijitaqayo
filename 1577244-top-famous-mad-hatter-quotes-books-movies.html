What does the Hatter say to Alice? These are the most quaint, silly and strangely profound quotes from Mad Hatter.</p><h2 id=1577244-1-there-is-a-place-like-no-place-on-earth-a-land-is-full-of-wonder-mystery-and-danger-some-say-to-survive-it-you-need-to-be-as-mad-as-a-hatter-which-luckily-i-am class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. There is a place like no place on earth. A land is full of wonder, mystery, and danger. Some say to survive it, you need to be as mad as a hatter. Which, luckily, I am.</h2><p class=align-left>Alice is seen stepping through a looking glass into a great <a href=#>world</a> in the story. Even though the Mad Hatter and other weird creatures live in the same world, Alice must do all she can to survive.</p><p class=align-left>This quote implies that to survive in a strange place, you must be "mad" as the Hatter and weird as the rest. After all, if you can't beat them, join them.</p><p class=align-left>Always be open-minded and imaginative when deciding to <a href=#>become successful</a> and get out of Wonderland, the land of imagination. Again, you must be a little bit crazy and always think diligently.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4015e9f50d6b2a45.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 best Johnny Cash quotes from songs and interviews</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fb69a4bc48fd46e0.png><h2 id=1577244-2-if-you-knew-time-as-well-as-i-do-you-wouldn39t-talk-about-wasting-it-it39s-him class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. If you knew time as well as I do, you wouldn't talk about wasting it. It's him.</h2><p class=align-left>The Mad Hatter reflects his eccentric perception of time. He personifies time, referring to it as "him," and implies that if one truly understood time, one wouldn't speak of wasting it.</p><p class=align-left>This quote could be interpreted as a reminder to appreciate and understand the complexity of time rather than viewing it narrowly as something to be measured and used efficiently.</p><h3 id=1577244-3-have-i-gone-mad class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. Have I gone mad?</h3><p class=align-left>Definitely, normal is boring, and there is nothing wrong with being different. Being different is something to be confident about.</p><p class=align-left>Those said to be "crazy" or bonkers" are considered the best <a href=#>people</a> from this quote from the Mad Hatter. Being a little mad, eccentric, and always thinking outside the box will help you make history and change the world.</p><h3 id=1577244-4-well-the-entire-world-is-falling-to-ruins-and-poor-cheshire39s-off-his-tea class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4.

This is one of the quotes that show Mad Hatter's ability to play with language.</p><p class=align-left>This quote brings out the weirdest of times: no matter how much time is running out and the world is falling apart on your end, there is always time to enjoy yourself with friends. Make use of every moment with your loved ones for every second matter. From this Mad Hatter tea party quote, it's important to make time to enjoy a cup of tea with your friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4015e9f50d6b2a45.png><h3 id=1577244-5-twinkle-twinkle-little-bat-how-i-wonder-where-you39re-at-up-above-the-world-you-fly-like-a-tea-tray-in-the-sky class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Twinkle twinkle, little bat, how I wonder where you're at. Up above the world, you fly like a tea- tray in the sky.</h3><p class=align-left>This was a Mad Hatter poem about a bat with a light twinkling like a star, flying above the world like a tea tray in the sky.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b744f0d0e9d74810.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ best villain quotes from movies and books that hit hard</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This nonsensical <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1529038-75-fun-riddles-teens-answers-mind-working/ href=#>riddle poem</a> asks about the bat flying so high in the sky. In return, the bat is not flying, but rather, it is hanging upside down from a tree, which is the answer to the riddle.</p><h3 id=1577244-6-you-mean-you-can39t-take-less-it39s-very-easy-to-take-more-than-nothing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. You mean you can't take less. It's very easy to take more than nothing.</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the famous Mad Hatter quotes about tea. He answers this after Alice is asked to have some tea by March, yet she has taken nothing. Mad Hatter interrupted and told her that having more of something would be easier than nothing.</p><p class=align-left>Whenever you have an opportunity to have something, have more of it rather than end up with nothing. Even if you don't have anything, don't limit yourself to nothing because the world has a lot to offer about anything. Do everything possible to have it as long as you have nothing to lose.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9258287fdf6cbfe4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>43 The Perks of Being a Wallflower quotes from the book and movie</span></p></a><h3 id=1577244-7-people-who-don39t-think-shouldn39t-talk class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7.

This quote will always encourage people to think before saying something. Those who talk without thinking tend to threaten people's feelings and emotions because what they say might hurt others.</p><p class=align-left>Again, thinking before talking will always make a difference in the world. As long as you <a href=#>can</a> think, you can express your ideas through talking and sharing them with the world, hence bringing change. So always think before talking!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d6035af061451a15.png><h3 id=1577244-8-trust-me-i-know-a-thing-or-two-about-liking-people-and-in-time-after-much-chocolate-and-cream-cake-39like39-turns-into-39what-was-his-name-again39 class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>8. Trust me. I know a thing or two about liking people, and in time, after much chocolate and cream cake, 'like' turns into 'what was his name again?'</h3><p class=align-left>Despite being Mad, the Mad Hatter knows people can change with time. He knows that most people are fake and move on where convenient. This is why he barely has many friends, not because of his madness. He is selective and choosy when choosing friends and allowing people to get close to him even though he is mad.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5e4c9aa4e39bd5c0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 best Blazing Saddles quotes from the iconic movie</span></p></a><h3 id=1577244-9-you-know-what-the-issue-is-with-this-world-everyone-wants-some-magical-solution-for-their-problem-and-everyone-refuses-to-believe-in-magic class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>9. You know what the issue is with this world? Everyone wants some magical solution for their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.</h3><p class=align-left>Most people dislike being creative and moving away from critical thinking. This makes them poor in decision-making and makes it difficult for them to find solutions to their problems. They are always contented with other people's solutions.</p><p class=align-left>There are so many people out there who are creative and have offered solutions to big problems, but imagine how the world would be if everyone brought out their creative side whenever we have a problem to solve.</p><h3 id=1577244-10-egad-you-learn-something-new-every-day-make-a-note-of-that-marchy-it-might-come-in-useful class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>10. Egad, you learn something new every day. Make a note of that, Marchy, it might come in useful.</h3><p class=align-left>The Mad Hatter's character is often associated with nonsensical logic and absurdity. However, this quote holds a valuable truth applicable to real-life situations.</p><p class=align-left>The Mad Hatter's advice to "make a note" suggests keeping an open mind to how seemingly unrelated information might be useful. This reflects the real-world value of interdisciplinary thinking and making connections across different fields.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b19c511b2d7d8298.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 iconic The Notebook quotes from the movie and novel</span></p></a><h2 id=1577244-famous-mad-hatter-lines class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Famous Mad Hatter lines</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a7ebed655d3edc9c.png><p class=align-left>Other popular Mad Hatter quotes on Disney include:</p><ul><li>Madness is the key to unlocking your true potential.</li><li>The Mad Hatter knows that imagination is the greatest escape from reality.</li><li>Madness is not a destination but a journey worth taking.</li><li>Normality is a paved road, but madness is an adventure waiting to unfold.</li><li>Madness is contagious; spread it with a smile.</li><li>A little madness goes a long way in making life interesting.</li><li>The Mad Hatterâ€™s world is a kaleidoscope of eccentricity and wonder.</li><li>Iâ€™m not crazy; my reality is just more interesting than yours.</li><li>Life is a perpetual tea party.
