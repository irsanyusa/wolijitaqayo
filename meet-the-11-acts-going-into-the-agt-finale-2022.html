After several weeks of amazing performances, America gets to crown their winner on Wednesday, September 14.</strong></p><p>This season of America’s Got Talent began with loads of talented contestants. With a shocking amount of contestants in the live shows and a whole new format for the quarter finals, it has been quite the season. Here’s the 11 acts continuing into the AGT season 17 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">finale</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-avery-dixon>1. Avery Dixon</h2><p>This 21 year old musician made waves in the competition and even earned Terry Crew’s Golden Buzzer early on in the competition. Throughout years of bullying, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Avery</a> found solace in his music. In current day, he’s ready to win the show and ultimately prove that he’s a seasoned performer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Chapel Hart</h2><p>Possibly one of the most popular groups of all is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapel Hart</a>. This country trio earned the coveted Group Golden Buzzer after wowing the judges with their debut “You Can Have Him Jolene” audition. Their song has gone viral, earned praise from Dolly Parton, and even landed them a performance at the Grand Ole Opry, could they be the winner of the season?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Drake Milligan</h2><p>Aside from Chapel Hart, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Drake Milligan</a> has made headlines of his own. The 24 year old, noted as “the new Elvis of country,” has gained similar exposure to Chapel Hart this season. The heartthrob was practically set to win, since his single hit No. 1 on iTunes after his audition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Metaphysic</h2><p>This group has brought one of the most unique talents ever in the show’s history. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphysic</a> Synthetic Media wowed the judges by creating an artificial intelligence version of Simon Cowell singing “You’re The Inspiration” by Chicago. They went on to impress once more when they made Cowell, Howie Mandel, and Terry Crews perform in the Qualifiers Round.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Mike E. Winfield</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike</a> was the first comedian to secure a place in the finale this season. After impressing in his audition, his Qualifier Round performance was just as impressive. His comedy is so smooth that Mandel offered to share a stage with him, if Mike wasn’t picked for the finale. Since Mandel has such high hopes for Mike, could he win the season?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Nicolas Ribs</h2><p>Fans were absolutely shocked when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicolas</a> secured a place in the finale instead of ventriloquist Celia Muñoz. This french magician performs unbelievable close-up magic that combines sleight of hand and projectors. His skills are definitely unique, so fans are interested to see his final performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Sara James</h2><p>13 year old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sara</a> earned Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer after her show stopping Billie Eilish cover. Since earning the coveted buzzer, she’s impressed once more with a beautiful rendition of “Rocketman” by Elton John. This singer has impressed the audience and judges each step of the way, so could she win the season?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Yu Hojin</h2><p>South Korean magician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yu Hojin</a> was the first magician to secure his place in the America’s Got Talent season 17 finale. The 29 year old has shown on multiple occasions that he’s able to make things appear out of thin air. Yu secured himself as a frontrunner early on the competition, could a magician win the show two years in a row?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. The Mayyas Dance Crew</h2><p>The Mayyas Dance Crew stunned right away on America’s Got Talent. Following their outstanding audition, they were awarded Sofia Vergara’s Golden Buzzer. The Mayyas have mesmerized us on several occasions, but is it enough to win the series?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Kristy Sellars</h2><p>Kristy is a pole dancer hailing from Australia, her act molds together pole dancing and technology. Her outstanding technological routine was enough to win Australia’s Got Talent in 2019. Could it be enough for her to succeed on the American series?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>11. Celia Muñoz</h2><p>Celia is one of the most unique ventriloquists to grace the America’s Got Talent stage. The opera singer made waves in the competition when she performed without any type of puppet on stage. Her voice was so impressive that America voted her back into the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_AGTLiveShow3_TraePattonNBC.jpg alt="How to Vote for The ‘America’s Got Talent’ Wildcard Instant Save 2022" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJufZBmmJyso2K0sLXNoGSipqSkerW0xGaYoKxdm7avrcueZGtoYmd8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
