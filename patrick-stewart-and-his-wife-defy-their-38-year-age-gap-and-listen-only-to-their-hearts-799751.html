Ozell was his 30-year-old waitress and she instantly caught his eye. As&nbsp;the actor <a href=#>recalled</a>: “It&nbsp;was an&nbsp;immediate attraction... She very kindly said she wanted to&nbsp;see Macbeth and then&nbsp;I gave her my&nbsp;mobile phone number.” He&nbsp;later <a href=#>admitted</a>, “It’s the only time in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life I’ve ever done that.” Stewart <a href=#>explained</a> that one of&nbsp;his rules was: “Don’t give out your number to&nbsp;somebody you don’t know!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/87f/942/81cd6e5701841311b90b3dd65f.jpg><p>So&nbsp;what prompted the actor to&nbsp;make such a&nbsp;bold move? You might say it&nbsp;was written in&nbsp;the stars. He&nbsp;<a href=#>explained</a>, “Instinct is&nbsp;everything in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation like that. I&nbsp;felt&nbsp;I was talking to&nbsp;a&nbsp;really nice, intelligent, interesting, gorgeous woman. It’s rare that those elements all come together at&nbsp;the same time.” Still, there’s a&nbsp;bit more to&nbsp;that story.</p><p><h2>Their talents served as&nbsp;perfect matchmakers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a77/595/d523f75259ac336167c214af9b.jpg><p>The night they met, Ozell asked Stewart for Macbeth tickets to&nbsp;see him perform on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Broadway data-link=tag>Broadway</a>, which is&nbsp;essentially why he&nbsp;gave her his number (even though the actor <a href=#>hints</a> there was an&nbsp;ulterior motive to&nbsp;his friendly gesture). Ozell loved the play and the 2&nbsp;<a href=#>started</a> seeing each other casually.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c01/8f4/98534858e584b93a274473c6ee.jpg><p>To&nbsp;Stewart’s surprise, his new flame also boasted a&nbsp;great talent. Ozell is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gifted jazz singer and Patrick <a href=#>admitted</a> it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;contributing factor for him: “Talent is&nbsp;very attractive. Never mind what anybody looks like. When you hear wonderful music, the appeal is&nbsp;almost irresistible.”</p><p><h2>They had quite an&nbsp;eventful wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/261/7e0/8d013c5ae6b7a231339c311778.jpg><p>The couple actually had to&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;ceremonies thanks to&nbsp;Patrick Stewart’s dear friend Ian McKellen, who was an&nbsp;officiant at&nbsp;both. Stewart <a href=#>revealed</a>, “We&nbsp;learned that he&nbsp;could not use his credentials in&nbsp;Nevada where we&nbsp;were getting <a href=# title=married data-link=tag>married</a>, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;invited Ian and 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;our guests and a&nbsp;director to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mexican restaurant [in&nbsp;LA] for dinner, but [they] had no&nbsp;idea what was happening. And in&nbsp;fact, we&nbsp;were formally married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mexican restaurant.” We&nbsp;say you can’t celebrate love enough anyway.</p><p><h2>Stewart and Ozell’s families had to&nbsp;get used to&nbsp;their union.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f53/cc4/b8a6205291be430cb31fc52135.jpg><p>There are very rarely only 2&nbsp;people in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>&nbsp;— sooner or&nbsp;later, <a href=# title=families data-link=tag>families</a> get involved, and considering Stewart’s age, it&nbsp;was inevitable. Ozell <a href=#>said</a> that the first hurdle was introducing her father to&nbsp;Patrick, who’s in&nbsp;fact 5&nbsp;years his senior. “My&nbsp;dad was not thrilled, at&nbsp;first,” admitted Ozell. Luckily, it&nbsp;was only a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;time and Sunny’s father eventually warmed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;his son-in-law. The actor even says they have their own inside jokes: “He&nbsp;rings me&nbsp;up&nbsp;and says ’Hey son, it’s your father here.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe6/b41/c3b1f05d3896c7e0cba0b57e7c.jpg><p>As&nbsp;for Stewart’s part of&nbsp;the family, Ozell was taking on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;both a&nbsp;stepmom and a&nbsp;step-grandma. She <a href=#>said</a> it&nbsp;was quite stressful but turned it&nbsp;out better than expected: “The trickiest bit was meeting his kids, who are 42&nbsp;and 47. That was territory&nbsp;I trod on&nbsp;very lightly. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;force myself on&nbsp;them... but they were very welcoming. One of&nbsp;Patrick’s grandkids&nbsp;— a&nbsp;12-year-old girl&nbsp;— is&nbsp;just now starting to&nbsp;get that it’s funny to&nbsp;call me&nbsp;Grandma.”</p><p><h2>They bridge the age difference seemlessly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ce/5aa/6e40625ad180a456869add9a4d.jpg><p>As&nbsp;for those 38&nbsp;years between them, Ozell actually <a href=#>admits</a> that it’s way less noticeable in&nbsp;their relationship than people think. “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;youthful and&nbsp;I guess I’m kind of&nbsp;an&nbsp;old worrywart, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;bridge the gap. It&nbsp;hasn’t come up&nbsp;much. He’s in&nbsp;better shape than I&nbsp;am, physically, which infuriates&nbsp;me,” she explained. And Stewart is&nbsp;simply annoyed that some people make that big of&nbsp;a&nbsp;deal out of&nbsp;it. “I&nbsp;cannot fully understand this age thing. It’s not a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;affectation, I&nbsp;honestly don’t know what happened, how&nbsp;I got here,” said the actor.</p><p>It’s quite clear to&nbsp;us that Patrick Stewart and Sunny Ozell aren’t just in&nbsp;love, they’re also perfect partners for each other. But what do&nbsp;you think about a&nbsp;significant age gap in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship? Have you ever been involved with someone way younger or&nbsp;older than you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2iwNGimqRlo6myuK3RrWSappRitaq%2FjLCgn51dmbKnxYytn56homKAeXnYnpirZZGcsm6zwKlkmqaUYrmqv9OepWannqHGbsDOZquhnZmneqmxwKurrGVnboZ4gZBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
