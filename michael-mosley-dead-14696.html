According to local authorities, he told friends at Agios Nikolaos beach on Wednesday afternoon that he would walk back to Symi town; he did not have his phone with him during the roughly two-mile walk. When he did not return after a few hours, his wife, Clare Bailey Mosley, reported him missing.</p><p>“It’s devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband,” Mosley’s wife said in a statement on Sunday, according to the BBC. “We’re taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn’t be easily seen by the extensive search team.”</p><p>Charlotte Moore, BBC chief content officer, said Mosley “was a brilliant science broadcaster and programme maker, able to make the most complex subjects simple, but he was also passionate about engaging and entertaining audiences, inspiring us all to live a healthier, fuller life.”</p><p>Moore continued, “His entertaining and accessible style was enjoyed by audiences around the world and he will be hugely missed by many people not least those fortunate enough to have worked with him at the BBC.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKymZLumw9JopKKbmJayrXnMqKqlnalisaatw2ZobW5pa3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
