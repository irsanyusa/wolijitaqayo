Pai’s term as commissioner ends this year, and the official said he will need to be reconfirmed by the end of this year’s congressional session — likely sometime in December — to remain at the post.</p><p>On Friday, several outlets reported that Trump was set to pick Pai as FCC chairman, prompting responses from several tech and telecommunication organizations. The choice of Pai is a win for an&nbsp;industry that has often complained about Wheeler’s tenure.</p><p>Gordon Smith, chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters, said in a press statement on Friday that his group “supports President Trump’s selection of Ajit Pai to the position of FCC chairman.”</p><p>More telecom organizations responded within minutes of the news of Pai’s announcement on Monday.</p><p>“Ajit Pai is an exceptional choice to head the Federal Communications Commission,” USTelecom President and Chief Executive Jonathan Spalter said in a statement. Spalter praised Pai’s “bold but pragmatic” strategy to “erase the many regulatory barriers” standing in the way of building increased broadband infrastructure.</p><p>David Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast Corp., said in a&nbsp;statement that Pai is “highly qualified to lead the commission.”</p><p>The Republicans on the House committee with jurisdiction over the FCC cheered the decision. “Today we welcome a new era of leadership and decision making at the FCC,” said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who chairs the telecom subcommittee.</p><p>Pai’s Democratic colleague on the FCC, Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, issued a statement congratulating Pai. “Ajit is&nbsp;bright, driven and committed to bringing connectivity to all Americans,” she said.</p><p><strong>Correction:</strong> A previous version of this story misidentified Blackburn’s home state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxfY5ramiZmp7BbrzAomSonpaesKqty6WwZqaVrHqktMCiqaaZnmKzpK%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
