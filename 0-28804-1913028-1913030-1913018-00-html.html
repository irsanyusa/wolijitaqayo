It was the &#34;apology&#34; that started it all. Written around 360 B.C., Plato's famous essay (from the Greek word apologia, meaning &#34;defense&#34;) recounts how Socrates defended himself against charges that he was corrupting Athen's youth and blaspheming local gods with his philosophical musings.
