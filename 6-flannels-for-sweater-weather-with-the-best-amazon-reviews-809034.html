The color is&nbsp;beautiful. It&nbsp;goes well with bright red or&nbsp;maroon shirts for layering. The material is&nbsp;very soft, albeit not a&nbsp;very heavy weight. They’ve done a&nbsp;good job of&nbsp;matching the pattern, and the sewing is&nbsp;well done. I&nbsp;washed it&nbsp;before&nbsp;I wore&nbsp;it, and it&nbsp;did shrink a&nbsp;little. This is&nbsp;all cotton and needs ironing after washing, but not after wearing. I&nbsp;purchased an&nbsp;XS. I&nbsp;am 59&nbsp;inches tall and weigh 110&nbsp;lbs. The arms are the perfect length when&nbsp;I fold up&nbsp;the cuffs. The body length is&nbsp;long, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very much on&nbsp;the fitted side width-wise. —&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Amazon Customer</i></a></li></ul><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;have never owned a&nbsp;Columbia shirt, but&nbsp;I love this one!

They are great! They fit well, wash well, don’t shrink, don’t need ironing, and the collars stay in&nbsp;shape. I&nbsp;purchased my&nbsp;first one quite a&nbsp;while back and it’s been in&nbsp;the wash every week. I&nbsp;purchased a&nbsp;couple more a&nbsp;few weeks later, and they have the same qualities as&nbsp;the first. I&nbsp;just picked up&nbsp;2&nbsp;more to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;patterns. They are my&nbsp;go-to shirts and are great with leggings, jeans, tucked&nbsp;in, left out, worn alone or&nbsp;with a&nbsp;t-shirt underneath. —&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Patricia&nbsp;BB</a></li></ul><p>Get it&nbsp;from Amazon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>HERE</strong></a></p><h2>3.

It’s not very warm, so&nbsp;I’d only recommend it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;nice fall day. It’s a&nbsp;little bit scratchy on&nbsp;the inside, but super soft on&nbsp;the outside. It&nbsp;fit super nicely! I&nbsp;did read some reviews that said the sleeves were kind of&nbsp;tight or&nbsp;didn’t fit around the wrists. I&nbsp;did not have this problem, but my&nbsp;wrists are super small, so&nbsp;that could be&nbsp;why. —&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amanda Shockey</a></li></ul><ul><li><i>I&nbsp;know flannel button-downs have been around forever. It&nbsp;seems they have come back into fashion and now everyone is&nbsp;wearing them. I&nbsp;was never really interested until recently. I&nbsp;got one as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hand-me-down from my&nbsp;daughter, and&nbsp;I loved it&nbsp;and needed more, which is&nbsp;what led me&nbsp;to&nbsp;this purchase. The style of&nbsp;shirt&nbsp;I chose does seem to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;tad on&nbsp;the larger side, but the sleeves fit perfectly. I&nbsp;normally wear between a&nbsp;small or&nbsp;a&nbsp;medium, and&nbsp;I ordered this in&nbsp;a&nbsp;medium. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;loose but very comfy. The outside is&nbsp;super soft and the inside is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little scratchy. It’s not uncomfortable though, as&nbsp;I wore it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;tank top and had no&nbsp;issues. I&nbsp;have machine washed and dried it&nbsp;a&nbsp;few times with no&nbsp;fading or&nbsp;deformation. I&nbsp;am thinking&nbsp;I will NEED to&nbsp;order at&nbsp;least one more. I&nbsp;am obsessed with how comfy and warm they are. For size reference, I&nbsp;am 5’3″ and 130&nbsp;lbs. My&nbsp;measurements are bust&nbsp;34″, waist&nbsp;28″, and hips 36″. —&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Nikki 💜</a></li></ul><p>Get it&nbsp;from Amazon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>HERE</strong></a></p><h2>4.

Ordered on&nbsp;23.12.2017, delivery took place on&nbsp;03.01.2017, so&nbsp;still absolutely justifiable. The shirt offers a&nbsp;slim cut and sits optimally on&nbsp;my&nbsp;stature. The material feels comfortable and is&nbsp;of&nbsp;high quality. The lining is&nbsp;great as&nbsp;the stomach and back area are optimally tightened by&nbsp;the inner lining and thus kept warm. The sleeves are fitted with a&nbsp;thermal cover on&nbsp;the inside, which makes them easy to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;and take off.</i><br><i>The seams are neatly pulled, and the press studs sit where they belong and keep everything nice and tight. I&nbsp;like the collar because it&nbsp;fits very snugly and does not stand at&nbsp;the back, as&nbsp;this can happen depending on&nbsp;the manufacturer.</i><br><i>I&nbsp;am absolutely satisfied and can highly recommend the flannel shirt! —&nbsp;</i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>L@rs 🎧 📷</a></li></ul><p>Get it&nbsp;from Amazon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>HERE</strong></a></p><h2>5.

Now I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;I can help others with the size query that seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;trend with these shirts because&nbsp;I must admit&nbsp;I was on&nbsp;the fence for a&nbsp;while about buying this shirt but I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;glad I&nbsp;did, and&nbsp;I will be&nbsp;getting more soon!! So&nbsp;I&nbsp;usually buy a&nbsp;UK size large shirt, so&nbsp;I got a&nbsp;large, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tad bigger than your average&nbsp;UK large, baggy but not too baggy, just a&nbsp;little loose. I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;large-tall, and&nbsp;I must say the shirt is&nbsp;long, which I&nbsp;like, but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;very long, so&nbsp;just bare that in&nbsp;mind. If&nbsp;you like shirts to&nbsp;fit snugly then&nbsp;I would suggest maybe getting a&nbsp;size down from your usual size, but if&nbsp;you like them a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loose fit, then get the size you usually get, but all around, I&nbsp;highly recommend these shirts.
