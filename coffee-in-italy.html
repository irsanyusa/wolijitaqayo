Imagine: you step out the door, reach the neighborhood bar (coffee house), walk to the counter and order a caffè macchiato (an espresso “stained” with a small spot of milk). Or, in the comfort of your own home, with your eyelids still heavy, you make your way to the kitchen and get that caffettiera or moca ready.</p><p>The history of coffee in Italy dates back to the 1600s — and from that first sip, Italians fell madly in love with this dark brew. So much so that they created and subsequently perfected one of the world’s most renowned coffee-brewing methods: the iconic espresso.</p><p>On that note, let’s wake up and take a journey from the Ottoman Empire to modern Italy, with stops to explore today’s variations of Italian coffee and how to order your next cup like a native.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=A-brief-history-of-coffee-in-Italy>A brief history of coffee in Italy</h2><p>Coffee was first cultivated in Ethiopia and eventually found its way to Europe through trading between La Serenissima (the Venetian Republic) and the Ottoman Empire. The bustling port of Venice subsequently became the gateway for the flavorful beans to enter the Old Continent.&nbsp;</p><p>Once it reached Italy, coffee led to the development of a new form of commerce and cultural exchange: the coffee house. The first coffee house (or bar) dates back to 1720 and is still in operation today. It is none other than the famous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Caffè Florian</a>, which sits in Piazza San Marco (St. Mark’s Square) in Venice.&nbsp;</p><p>Coffee bars soon became known as establishments where artists, writers and other intellectuals could share inspiring conversations as well as a cup of the dark brew. It wasn’t long before the bitter and full-bodied aroma of roasted coffee beans spread like wildfire across Europe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Types-of-coffee>Types of coffee</h2><p>If you’ve ever traveled to Italy, you may have noticed that a simple “Caffè, per favore!” (“Coffee, please!”) will typically yield only a tiny cup of espresso. Fear not: when browsing the menu at a buzzing coffee bar, you’ll usually encounter a wider selection of drink choices.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure you get exactly what you wish, let’s recap what to expect when ordering a lungo, a cheeky corretto or a classic cappuccino.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Espresso</h3><p>Probably the most recognizable of all coffees, this shot of pure adrenaline is bound to keep you energized throughout your busy morning. Some tourists might find it ridiculously small, quantity-wise, but traditionally an espresso is enjoyed quickly, while standing at the bar before moving on to your next destination.</p><p>Want an espresso but still feel it isn’t quite enough? You can ask for double the dose by simply ordering a doppio (double).</p><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> The Italian word espresso means “pressed out.” This likely references the way this type of coffee is prepared, i.e. by forcing hot water through the ground beans. Alternatively, the name might refer to the fact that this coffee is prepared on the spot at a customer’s request, rather than ahead of time.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cappuccino</h3><p>Many Italians will declare that you should never order a cappuccino after 11 a.m., but the best coffee is the one you enjoy the most. The key to a good cappuccino is the same whenever you enjoy it: mix the coffee, steamed milk and milk foam in equal parts.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Ristretto</h3><p>The first variation on espresso might surprise you. Ristretto translates to “restricted,” and this type of coffee is brewed with the same amount of ground beans as an espresso but with half the amount of water. Could your coffee get any stronger?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lungo</h3><p>On the opposite end of the espresso spectrum, you’ll find the lungo, meaning “long.” But don’t get your hopes up: the quantity of this type of coffee still won’t compare to the americano. Expect an espresso brewed with a slightly higher amount of water — not enough to warrant a bigger cup, though.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Macchiato</h3><p>Another variation on the espresso is the macchiato, which literally translates to “stained” or “spotted.” To make this type of coffee, the bartender adds a drop of steamed milk to “stain” it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Caffè Latte</h3><p>For the typical morning drink known as the caffè latte, a shot of espresso is drowned in a larger amount of milk. It’s an ideal alternative if you prefer a lighter coffee, and it pairs especially well with some cookies or toast for breakfast.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Corretto</h3><p>The cheekiest of coffees in Italy, this variation is usually enjoyed after a meal and its name means “corrected.” How do you prepare it? Add a shot of your favorite spirit into your espresso, and there you have it. The most common correttos are usually served with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grappa</a>, brandy, sambuca or rum.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Shakerato</h3><p>Anyone who enjoys a cold drink will fall in love with this type of coffee. You might have guessed that shakerato means “shaken.” On a hot summer day, your local bartender might offer to prepare you what is basically an iced coffee, mixing espresso and ice cubes in a cocktail shaker and serving it in a classic martini glass.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-order-coffee-like-an-Italian>How to order coffee like an Italian</h2><p>You’re now well-equipped to face any bar you may come across on a stroll through sunny Tuscany or hectic Sicily. So, to cap it off, here are some helpful phrases for ordering coffee in Italy, plus some tips on general bar etiquette.</p><ul><li>Buongiorno, vorrei un caffè per piacere. (Good morning, I would like a coffee, please.)</li></ul><p>In this instance, expect to be served an espresso.</p><ul><li>Ciao, mi faresti un… ? (Hello, would you make/prepare me a [insert coffee]?)</li><li>Un macchiato, per favore. (A macchiato, please.)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>You can use this phrase to order pretty much anything in a bar; just insert your favorite caffeinated drink in place of a macchiato.</p><ul><li>Un lungo in tazza grande, per piacere. (An espresso lungo in a big cup, please.)</li></ul><p>For those who wish to add some extra milk, this is a way to get a cappuccino-size cup instead of an espresso cup.</p><p>Bartenders might ask if you have any preference in terms of milk, too. Expect to hear:</p><ul><li>Lo vuole con latte di soia/mandorle? Con latte vaccino? (Would you like it with soy/almond milk? Or with cow milk?)</li><li>Che latte preferisce? (What milk would you prefer?)</li></ul><p>To which you can reply:</p><ul><li>(Con) Latte di soia/riso/mandorla/avena, grazie. (With soy/rice/almond/oat milk, thank you.)</li><li>(Con) Latte vaccino/normale, per piacere. (With cow/normal milk, please.)</li><li>Potrei averlo con latte di soia, per piacere? (Could I have it with soy milk, please?)</li><li>Potrei avere del latte d’avena freddo di lato, per piacere? (Could I have some cold oat milk on the side, please?)</li></ul><p>As in most places, once you enter a bar, you should greet the bartender with a “Buongiorno” or “Ciao” before ordering your drink.</p><p>Once ready, you can ask for the bill by asking, “Quanto ti devo?” (How much do I owe you?).</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In Italy, it’s not common to ask for a coffee to take away. In keeping with Italian tradition, you can either order it and drink it standing or sit down and sip it on a sunny terrace.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The best coffee is the one you love</h2><p>Ultimately, the best coffee is the cup <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you enjoy </a>drinking the most, regardless of its water ratio, size and spoonfuls of sugar. With this guide, we welcome you to the delicious world of coffee in Italy, which is often confusing but always entertaining. Whether prepared as an espresso or as a playful corretto, coffee remains a heartfelt tradition Italians pride themselves on.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Valentina.jpg><h2>Valentina Rampazzo</h2><p><a href=#>Valentina Rampazzo</a> is an Italian Content Manager and writer.
