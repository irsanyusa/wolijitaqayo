At only 18 years old, Kique has already learned how to deliver his own soulful renditions properly. This singer has proven throughout his time on The Voice that he is a stellar member of Team Gwen.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kique-impressed-right-away-with-stunning-sean-kingston-rendition>Kique Impressed Right Away With Stunning Sean Kingston Rendition</h2><p>Kique’s journey on The Voice began after he showcased his rendition of “Beautiful Girls,” by Sean Kingston on the blind auditions, both Shelton and Stefani turned for him. Eventually, the singer decided to join Team Gwen.</p><p>Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stefani</a> has trouble pronouncing his name at times, she is fully capable of polishing his tone and style. This coach has never swayed away from Kique’s side this season. She picked him as the Battle winner over Tanner Howie, who has a higher vocal range, and he even won his Knockout Round too.</p><p>During the Knockout rounds, Kique put a beautiful spin on the classic tune “Hey Ya” by Outkast. Even though the song was very different from the popular tune, the audience and judges loved it.</p><p>“One of my favorite things to do is change songs,” Kique said. “I really want Gwen to see that I’m not just <a href=#>a singer</a>. I’m also a musician. I like to create compositions and make music and change things and make them my own.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Was Kique Before The Voice?</h2><p>As stated on the show, Kique was born in Miami, Florida and his family is Cuban. It’s been reported that he got his start in music while attending an all-boys Catholic School. While in school, he began performing in school concerts and recording songs.</p><p>It’s evident that this young singer is trying to launch his professional career on The Voice, since he has a relatively low follow count on social media. He has 8,159 followers on Instagram, 2656 followers on TikTok, and 348 followers on Twitter. As of writing, he has not released any songs to streaming.</p><p>Kique has truly proven that he’s a strong voice in the competition. Due to his uniqueness, coaching, and song choices, he could be one of the singers left in this season’s finale. Be sure to tune into NBC on Mondays and Tuesdays to follow Kique’s journey on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_AleXa_JC-OliveraGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Song Contest’ Winner AleXa Releases New Single ‘Back in Vogue’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYsGmrcxmnrCdnqh6rLXQrpxmn5%2Bisrt5wGabopmdpLulecinZK2glWK%2FsMHGoWSopl2ptaZ51aignJ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
