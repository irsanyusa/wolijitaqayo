Harry Potter was the saga that made&nbsp;us all fall in&nbsp;love with <a href=# title=magic data-link=tag>magic</a> again and thanks to&nbsp;its beloved characters, we&nbsp;discovered that a&nbsp;little <a href=# title=mystery data-link=tag>mystery</a> is&nbsp;nothing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;afraid&nbsp;of. That’s why today we&nbsp;thought we’d take a&nbsp;one-way ticket to&nbsp;nostalgia city and see how the supporting actors from the saga have changed over 2&nbsp;decades.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;pay tribute to&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the greatest characters J.K. Rowling came up&nbsp;with and that we&nbsp;didn’t really have the chance to&nbsp;see for a&nbsp;longer time onscreen, even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;to.</p><p><h2>1. Molly Weasley: Julie Walters</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e4/8b9/ac56f45a3685155cf7340e0c39.jpg><p>The mother of&nbsp;Ron Weasley, Harry’s best friend, played one of&nbsp;the most important yet underrated roles in&nbsp;the saga. She was maybe the only mother figure Harry Potter had in&nbsp;his life after his parents died. She was played by&nbsp;actress <a href=#>Julie Walters</a>, who’s not short on&nbsp;charisma. Another beloved character this actress brought to&nbsp;the big screen is&nbsp;Rosie Mulligan from Mamma Mia!</p><p><h2>2. Arthur Weasley: Mark Williams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/083/8b2/2a9515554c9ac9cba519d485b4.jpg><p>And there’s no&nbsp;way we&nbsp;can forget Arthur Weasley. Ron’s father worked at&nbsp;the Ministry of&nbsp;Magic Affairs doing research about the lives of&nbsp;non-magical people, also sometimes referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;muggles. He&nbsp;always supported and welcomed Harry as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;his family. Actor <a href=#>Mark Williams</a> is&nbsp;best known for being a&nbsp;British comedian and he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;major role in&nbsp;the popular BBC series The Fast Show.</p><p><h2>3. Fleur Delacour: Clémence Poésy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/108/058/805d2259dea74b3ba65308b986.jpg><p>We&nbsp;got to&nbsp;meet Fleur Delacour for the first time in&nbsp;the fourth installment, where she took part in&nbsp;the Triwizard Tournament as&nbsp;the favorite candidate for Beauxbatons School. After that, Fleur ended up&nbsp;marrying the oldest of&nbsp;the Weasley brothers, Bill. French actress <a href=#>Clémence Poésy</a> has continued her career in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> industry. And among her latest films, you’ll find Tenet.</p><p><h2>4. Viktor Krum: Stanislav Ianevski</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/845/3a3/7d4309576cadb9154c08760dea.jpg><p>Just like Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum was one of&nbsp;the participants of&nbsp;the Triwizard Tournament. He&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;well-known quidditch player. Despite those exploits, you might actually remember him for his failed attempt to&nbsp;conquer Hermione’s heart. But actually, the last time he&nbsp;appears in&nbsp;the story is&nbsp;at&nbsp;Fleur and Bill Weasley’s wedding. This exotic character was played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Stanislav Ianevski</a>, a&nbsp;Bulgarian actor who continued working on&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;other films after his role in&nbsp;the wizard’s saga. One of&nbsp;the best-known films he&nbsp;took part in&nbsp;is&nbsp;Resistance.</p><p><h2>5. Dean Thomas: Alfred Enoch</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d25/79a/7a77365ea4b50c4f8b932a0b17.jpg><p>From the first movie and throughout the entire saga, Harry had a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;memorable housemates who he&nbsp;ran into from time to&nbsp;time in&nbsp;Gryffindor’s common house or&nbsp;around the school. One of&nbsp;them was Dean Thomas, played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Alfred Enoch</a>. The actor is&nbsp;half-English and half-Brazilian. He&nbsp;became more popular over the years, especially after he&nbsp;was cast for one of&nbsp;the lead roles in&nbsp;the series How to&nbsp;Get Away With Murder and we&nbsp;were surprised to&nbsp;find out that he&nbsp;was Harry Potter’s friend from Gryffindor! He&nbsp;also appeared in&nbsp;Sherlock and in&nbsp;Troy: Fall of&nbsp;a&nbsp;City.</p><p><h2>6. Seamus Finnigan: Devon Murray</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22c/0df/e4e76f526e8b599f0b09895fcd.jpg><p>Seamus was another of&nbsp;Harry’s schoolmates who, while not always agreeing with him, showed his support throughout most of&nbsp;the saga. Seamus was actually Dean’s best friend and they even shared a&nbsp;room. He&nbsp;was played by&nbsp;actor Devon Murray. This actor also enjoys spending time with <a href=#>horses</a>, and has owned <a href=#>at&nbsp;least 6</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>7. Madame Olympe Maxime: Frances de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Tour</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8db/834/1b3c345e6fb55bcc519a8c7e46.jpg><p><a href=#>Frances de&nbsp;la&nbsp;Tour</a> brought Madame Maxime to&nbsp;the big screen. Maxime was a&nbsp;very senior director at&nbsp;Beauxbatons and also the only woman we&nbsp;saw Hagrid take interest&nbsp;in, at&nbsp;least in&nbsp;the movies. In&nbsp;2006, she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Play for <a href=#>her performance</a> in&nbsp;The History of&nbsp;Boys. Later in&nbsp;her career, she worked on&nbsp;<a href=#>Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland</a> and Netflix’s <a href=#>Enola Holmes</a> based on&nbsp;the first book of&nbsp;the Enola Holmes series written by&nbsp;Nancy Springer.</p><p><h2>8. Professor Sprout: Miriam Margolyes</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/48e/963/f63582519081eff28e98efa4a9.jpg><p>Professor Sprout taught a&nbsp;strange subject at&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hogwarts data-link=tag>Hogwarts</a> School of&nbsp;Magic, Herbology. She was also the head of&nbsp;the Hufflepuff House and was always seen as&nbsp;this sweet and friendly teacher, the kind of&nbsp;person you’d like to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;trouble. <a href=#>Miriam Margolyes</a>, the actress who was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;playing this character, studied English at&nbsp;Cambridge University and she’s proud of&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;fun fact is&nbsp;that she openly admitted to&nbsp;not liking actor Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in&nbsp;the first installments of&nbsp;the saga.</p><p><h2>9. Professor Trelawney: Emma Thompson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ae/32a/0f97235304a23da833b5ad10b1.jpg><p>Sybill Trelawney was the Divination teacher at&nbsp;Hogwarts School. She was the person who made the prophecy concerning how Harry and the rest would defeat He-who-can’t-be-named. She also made the prophecy about “the chosen one.” This character was played by&nbsp;the Emmy, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and Oscar-winning actress <a href=#>Emma Thompson</a>. Thomson, besides being one of&nbsp;the most famous British actresses in&nbsp;the world, is&nbsp;also known for her passionate dedication to&nbsp;environmental causes. She has supported several campaigns against climate change on&nbsp;numerous occasions, including some for the international NGO Greenpeace.</p><p><h2>10. Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody: Brendan Gleeson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/177/dc7/6b2938539081b091574f846964.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;all the professors that Harry had during his student days at&nbsp;Hogwarts, Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody was one of&nbsp;the strangest ones: from his sloppy appearance and his fake glass eye, to&nbsp;his irreverent, twitchy attitude, there was nothing ordinary about this man. <a href=#>Brendan Gleeson</a>’s looks and character, aside from those of&nbsp;this strange wizard, are actually very sweet. When he’s not acting, the actor likes to&nbsp;play the mandolin or&nbsp;fiddle. He&nbsp;has appeared in&nbsp;many movies, including Scorsese’s Gangs of&nbsp;New York.</p><p><h2>11. Narcissa Malfoy: Helen McCrory</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/53a/415/51084d5a6ab8a7289e0e7f958a.jpg><p><a href=#>Helen McCrory</a> played Narcissa Malfoy, the mother of&nbsp;Draco Malfoy, Harry’s longtime nemesis at&nbsp;school and later on&nbsp;in&nbsp;battle. Even though the character of&nbsp;Narcissa doesn’t really appear too much on-screen throughout the saga, she is&nbsp;definitely an&nbsp;important one. She actually changes the faith of&nbsp;many characters, including her own son, by&nbsp;supporting Harry’s team when the time comes, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;save her son. After playing this role, Helen McCrory took part in&nbsp;several projects amongst which is&nbsp;Penny Dreadful, a&nbsp;gothic horror series.</p><p><h2>12. Peter Pettigrew aka Scabbers: Timothy Spall</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b7/012/d8b0d25431a33d2e2c54aa1ae5.jpg><p>Peter Pettigrew, better known in&nbsp;the books and the movies as&nbsp;Scabbers, was an&nbsp;animago capable of&nbsp;turning into a&nbsp;rat. This strange ability allowed him to&nbsp;pretend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Ron Weasley’s pet for years. This character is&nbsp;remembered as&nbsp;the faithful servant of&nbsp;He-who-can’t-be-named for a&nbsp;long time. Despite being diagnosed with leukemia in&nbsp;1996, actor <a href=#>Timothy Spall</a> has continued his career in&nbsp;film and television. Some of&nbsp;his latest projects include movies like <a href=#>It&nbsp;Snows in&nbsp;Benidorm</a> and Nick Park’s animated movie <a href=#>Early Man</a>.</p><p><h2>13. Remus Lupin: David Thewlis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8a/84d/1c350a5eaf9d0b46c133648e29.jpg><p>The third installment of&nbsp;the saga introduces one of&nbsp;the most memorable characters and beloved professors in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;these movies, Remus Lupin. This professor of&nbsp;Defense Against the Dark Arts teaches Harry how to&nbsp;conjure a&nbsp;Patronus to&nbsp;keep dementors at&nbsp;bay. Apart from being a&nbsp;werewolf, he&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;Harry’s father’s best friends. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;his role in&nbsp;Harry Potter, <a href=#>David Thewlis</a> has appeared in&nbsp;other famous movies like Wonder Woman and Justice League in&nbsp;2017. In&nbsp;these films, he&nbsp;played Ares, the god of&nbsp;war.</p><p><h2>14. Rita Skeeter: Miranda Richardson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2da/715/1ce061571d9ff4b415b7f0fcf2.jpg><p>You probably remember this nosy reporter that appeared throughout the saga. She was always looking for embarrassing stories to&nbsp;write about in&nbsp;the newspaper or&nbsp;in&nbsp;books. Her name was Rita Skeeter and she was played by&nbsp;famous British actress <a href=#>Miranda Richardson</a>. This character appeared very rarely, but she always liked to&nbsp;draw attention to&nbsp;herself with her exotic personality and exuberant style.</p><p><h2>15. Xenophilius Lovegood: Rhys Ifans</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d6/a29/9f6fda56848ffba6c8715b8249.jpg><p>Another character who had a&nbsp;very small role in&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;Harry Potter was Luna’s father, Xenophilius Lovegood. Still, this character conveyed a&nbsp;mysterious and extravagant aura that drew everyone’s attention the minute he&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;the screen. Something you might not know about actor <a href=#>Rhys Ifans</a> is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;Haverfordwest and his mother tongue is&nbsp;Welsh. He&nbsp;actually decided to&nbsp;use the Welsh spelling to&nbsp;write his last name Evans as&nbsp;Ifans, for his stage name. After Harry Potter, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man, among other movies.</p><p>What is&nbsp;your favorite scene from the Harry Potter movies?
