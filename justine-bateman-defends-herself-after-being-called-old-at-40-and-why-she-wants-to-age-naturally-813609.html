But after that, she shifted her focus from acting to&nbsp;working behind the scenes. Now, she’s a&nbsp;successful author and director. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, the actress, now 57&nbsp;years old, came back into the spotlight to&nbsp;share an&nbsp;important message with all women concerned about getting older.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c6/575/f5f355522bb5f4d6ccd6016724.jpg><p><h2>When she reached her 40s, people considered her “old.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/680/073/ad87b950908513a515afd6664b.jpg><p>Invision / Invision / East News<span>, </span>Invision / Invision / East News</p><p>Justine didn’t think about getting older until she had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>search</a> for something online. She wanted to&nbsp;research and refresh her memory about something that happened during her fame. But when she typed her name, Justine Bateman, into Google, the search autocomplete suggested: “looks old.” This happened when she was only around 40&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>That revelation actually boosted her self-confidence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9de/a6c/8df6e65ee29540d3b54d6e5c93.jpg><p>When questioned whether she had ever considered cosmetic procedures, Justine explained that plastic surgery would cause her to&nbsp;“lose all of&nbsp;her authority.” She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> contentment with her current appearance and emphasized that she finds satisfaction in&nbsp;the visible signs that indicate she has evolved into a&nbsp;different individual from her younger self.</p><p><h2>She even decided to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;book about her experiences.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43f/1c8/1de24a5e6aabb6ff1026d2e504.jpg><p>Justine doesn’t criticize those who choose to&nbsp;undergo beauty treatments to&nbsp;appear younger, but she does <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>express</a> a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;sadness for them. She explains that she feels sorry for those so&nbsp;preoccupied with the idea of&nbsp;fixing their appearance that it&nbsp;distracts them from focusing on&nbsp;the meaningful aspects of&nbsp;life. In&nbsp;2021, Justine Bateman released a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a> titled “Face: One Square Foot of&nbsp;Skin,” which addresses this significant issue.</p><p><h2>Women shouldn’t spend too much time fixating on&nbsp;their looks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8dc/231/750a245c1d9106d0fd02084108.jpg><p>Justine shared some exciting news: “There’s absolutely nothing wrong with your face!” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> as&nbsp;the caption for an&nbsp;Instagram post promoting her book. Justine draws from her experiences to&nbsp;illustrate society’s obsession with how women’s faces transform as&nbsp;they age. When asked about the beauty of&nbsp;aging, Justine firmly states that she doesn’t care about others’ opinions. She confidently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asserts</a>, “I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I look rad. My&nbsp;face represents who I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;like&nbsp;it, and that’s basically the end of&nbsp;the road.”</p><p>Several notable figures in&nbsp;the public eye have made the conscious choice to&nbsp;embrace natural aging, rejecting the pressure to&nbsp;undergo cosmetic interventions. One such individual is&nbsp;<a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>, who boldly opted to&nbsp;age gracefully without relying on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> or&nbsp;similar treatments. After an&nbsp;unpleasant experience where Botox altered her appearance in&nbsp;an&nbsp;unexpected manner, Diaz decided to&nbsp;embrace her natural features and allow the aging process to&nbsp;unfold authentically.</p><p>Preview photo credit Invision / Invision / East News<span>, </span>Invision / Invision / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLe2v9OipZ5lkpbBprnAp2SdnZaau6W%2FjKGcq6uVobNurcWtnKtlkpq2r7OMnJilpJWZerC4w2aYrWVkZXqiusNmrqGxXai1pnnWmqWtq12pvG6txp5kp5mkqr%2BiuMuyZHFpY2t9ens%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
